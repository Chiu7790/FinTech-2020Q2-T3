But one piece of the interior had some people scratching their heads. While it looks fun and futuristic, the usability of the yoke style steering wheel was immediately questioned. The missing top of the wheel allows a much more open view of the road and instrument cluster, while also giving the car a more open feeling. And many agree it looks great as well. But how easily would one be able to drive without having the top part of the wheel there, especially after knowing nothing but a fully round wheel? The Tesla owner in the video below (starting around 26:24) seems to really enjoy the yoke, and the steering and use look very natural. \"One hand driving's also not a problem,\" says the owner. He goes on to say it's really comfortable, and says he's used to it now after an initial break-in period. Benzinga's Take: Like many things Tesla, the yoke is radically different from other production vehicles. The Model 3 and Y lack any type of instrument cluster in front of the wheel, only offering a center screen. When first using the car, these features can be intimidating, but as seen in the video above, it takes just a small amount of time, and people can enjoy and even prefer the distinct changes Tesla makes.

(TSLA) seems to have nearly sold out the Model Y Long Range variant in Q3 based on recent registration figures, as per Teslarati. Shares rose 1.3% to close at $617.69 on June 14. The earliest possible delivery date for the Model Y Long Range variant has been extended to September, which is the end of the company\u2019s third quarter of FY2021. Tesla\u2019s all-electric crossover Model Y has already proven to be more popular than the all-electric Model 3 sedan in markets such as China and California. (See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks) The overwhelming demand for the Model Y has led to a price hike of $3,500 so far this year, despite the company cutting the cost of the car considerably in February. Tesla has also made several alterations to the Model Y this year, including removing a lumbar-support option in the passenger\u2019s seat and the removal of radar equipment in both the Model Y and Model 3, as a means to progress towards the company\u2019s Full Self-Driving ambitions. During the company\u2019s Q1 2021 Earnings Call, CEO Elon Musk said, \u201cWhen it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world and probably next year\u2026 I\u2019d say more likely than not, that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.\u201d With the company already selling out of its Q2 production volumes in early May, Tesla has been on a rampage, trying to scale up manufacturing capabilities for all of its vehicles, with Model Y being the prime focus as it expands geographically. Yesterday, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $820, implying 32.8% upside potential to current levels. In his latest Global EV report, Rakesh stated, \u201cWe believe TSLA remains the battery electric vehicle (BEV) market share leader globally, with ~24% market share\u2026While we expect to see emerging competition for TSLA in the coming quarters with the VW ID.4, Mercedes EQS, and Mustang Mach-E, (among others), we would note the complexity and investment required to successfully ramp and integrate battery technology and new EV platforms.\u201d The stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 9 Buys, 6 Holds, and 7 Sells. The TSLA average analyst price target of $620.70 implies that shares are almost fully valued at current levels.

(Reuters) - Long-time Tesla Inc executive and president Jerome Guillen, who left the company earlier in June, has sold an estimated $274 million worth of shares after exercising stock options since June 10, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing, which was submitted to the SEC on Tuesday, said that Guillen expected to sell 215,718 shares for $129 million that day, and that he offloaded another 145,289 stocks worth $89.6 million on June 14, and 90,111 stocks worth $55 million on June 10. \"It could raise some eyebrows for investors,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said, adding that investors are going to watch closely to see if he sells more. Guillen, a former Mercedes engineer who was with Tesla since 2010, oversaw the company's entire vehicles business before being named president of the Tesla Heavy Trucking unit in March. He left the company on June 3. The departure of Guillen, one of Tesla's top four leaders, including CEO Elon Musk, has sparked market concerns about Tesla's future vehicle programs like the Semi electric trucks and new batteries called 4680 cells. Stock options give employees and executives the right to buy their company's stock at a specified price for a certain period of time. When share prices rise above the exercise price, they can buy the stocks at discounted prices. It was not immediately known how much Guillen paid to exercise the options.

For one, obviously, it is a pioneer in the field of electric vehicles and a leader in electric vehicle battery technology. There are also few, if any, CEOs as magnetic as Elon Musk. Other OEMs are also constantly playing catch up with Tesla\u2019s innovations, said Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer following last week\u2019s launch of Tesla\u2019s fastest vehicle-to-date, the Model S Plaid. \u201cWhile others are establishing battery supply chains, Tesla is innovating past the battery,\u201d the 5-star analyst claimed. \u201cFirst demonstrated with the inaugural use of SiC in their traction inverter, and now with electric motor design. This is a product of Tesla\u2019s culture, and places them further ahead on the innovation curve compared to legacy OEM competitors.\u201d This \u201csystem level approach\u201d has now turned its gaze toward motors. To allow for improved strength to weight ratio required to stop the motor from pulling itself apart at 20,000 rpm, the new motor is carbon wrapped, amounting to an industry first. And to provide a more efficient electromagnetic field and sustain tighter gaps at higher rpm, the company has designed and constructed a machine that can wind the copper rotors at much higher tension. Dorsheimer expects this will lead to \u201cindustry-wide improvements in motor design.\u201d However, while Dorsheimer evidently thinks highly of Tesla, the fact it will now not offer the Model S Plaid Plus - rumored to be the first model to boast the new 4680 cell design - suggests the new cell format \u201cisn\u2019t ready for production just yet, and cell production capacity constraints for energy storage products like Powerwall remain.\u201d Throw into the mix inflation-related macro, near-term uncertainty and Fed policy \u201ccausing a sector rotation out of growth and into value names,\u201d and Dorsheimer is driven to reduce his Tesla price target from $974 to $812. There\u2019s still room for gains of ~35% from current levels, while the analyst\u2019s rating stays a Buy. (To watch Dorsheimer\u2019s track record, click here) Overall, Tesla remains a polarizing name on Wall Street, reflected in a wide array of opinions from the experts. Based on 9 Buys, 6 Holds and 7 Sells, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Hold. The forecast is for 12-month gains of a modest 3.5%, given the average price target currently stands at $620.70.

Investors who have bought and held this stock over the past decade have seen absolutely insane returns. The question of whether Tesla has grown to a size that doesn\u2019t make sense anymore is a topic of conversation for many investors. At this point, the company has been valued at just shy of $600 billion. (See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks) For investors on the fence with Tesla, it pays to be aware of some bearish catalysts facing Tesla stock right now. Tesla Stock Could be In For Some Pain There are several pertinent bearish catalysts about which Tesla investors could be cautious. For one, broadly speaking, EV stocks have been hit by inflation-induced bond yield increases in recent months. Indeed, all growth stocks have this headwind to contend with at the moment. Additionally, as has been known for awhile, a global EV chip shortage is threatening production numbers for all high-growth EV players such as Tesla. Moreover, earnings quality has become a big issue for investors. The fact that Tesla\u2019s still losing a ton of money making electric vehicles, yet is able to report a profit due to unsustainable cash flow streams (namely, Bitcoin trading and the sale of emissions credits), is worrisome to many long-term investors. Also, valuation concerns have begun to take hold with Tesla stock. This stock still trades at more than 16 times sales and 600 times earnings. As mentioned above, those earnings primarily comprise non-operating profits. One of the most famous investors of our time, Michael Burry, who is known for his role in The Big Short, has placed an absolutely massive short bet on Tesla. His recently-filed form 13-F spells out an incredible short, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen in a long time. Obviously, Burry is not predicting continued growth for Tesla. Another worry concerns Chinese orders for Tesla vehicles, which were nearly cut in half last month. This comes as U.S.-China tensions ramp up. China is the largest global market for electric vehicles, accounting for approximately one half of the global EV market. Thus, Tesla\u2019s key growth engine appears to be revving down considerably. Finally, the intense level of competition in the global EV market is heating up in an incredible fashion. Competitors are producing more EVs at better price points than Tesla. Their EVs offer technological improvements and product enhancements that close the rather large gap Tesla had in this regard not too long ago. How Much Weight Should Investors Give These Catalysts? Investors in Tesla may still argue that there are reasons to own Tesla stock. Among the key reasons to be bullish on Tesla are Gigafactory projects in Berlin and Texas. Tesla believers are hopeful these projects will be able to potentially increase production capacity by as much as 500% overall. However, given global chip shortage issues and the rise of competitive forces and nationalistic endeavors from key markets such as China, the global sales outlook for Tesla may simply not be as bright as many Tesla investors may want to believe. Producing cars is fantastic. However, it\u2019s unclear whether Tesla will see the kind of sales numbers materialize in a few years\u2019 time when more players hit the market and aggressively compete for the growing market Tesla has (mostly) had all to itself for quite some time. Additionally, CEO Elon Musk has continued to promise full self driving technology and robotaxis for years. While these have yet to materialize, one Chinese company Baidu (BIDU) has already launched a fully autonomous robotaxi service in Beijing. Accordingly, this is a technological race it appears Elon Musk\u2019s team has lost. What Analysts Are Saying About TSLA Stock According to TipRanks\u2019 analyst rating consensus, TSLA stock comes in as a Hold. Out of 23 analyst ratings, there are 10 Buy recommendations, 7 Hold recommendations, and 6 Sell recommendations. As for price targets, the average analyst price target is $639.81, with a potential upside of 4.9%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $67.00 per share to a high of $1,080.00 per share. Bottom Line Tesla is a mega-cap company for a reason. This company\u2019s brand and passionate CEO are the reasons most investors continue to hold on to these shares. However, given other recent catalysts bearish to the Tesla discussion, there may be more downside on the horizon. Investors should always be reminded that trees don\u2019t grow all the way to the sky. When stocks get this large, growth tends to slow. It is wise for investors to remain cautious about placing outlandish growth expectations on companies valued as highly as Tesla. At some point, the valuation stops making sense.

His avid support for the crypto-currency has gone a long way toward shifting public perception in favor of Bitcoin and has boosted the asset\u2019s legitimacy in global marketplaces. Bitcoin owes much to Musk for its recent boom and soaring prices as the cryptocurrency enters the mainstream in no small part thanks to the Tesla CEO\u2019s decision to buy $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin through the electric car company and begin accepting the currency as a valid method of payment.\u00a0 This risky move was just the beginning of what would turn out to be a monthslong rollercoaster of dramatic events and market turmoil for Musk, Tesla, and Bitcoin. First, the bold purchase and very public endorsement of a very volatile cryptocurrency scared off Tesla\u2019s investors in a big way. On the heels of the Bitcoin purchase Tesla\u2019s previously skyrocketing stock prices dropped dramatically, turning the company negative for the year in February.\u00a0 \u201cThis pullback really started after Tesla made the decision to buy $1.5 billion of bitcoin,\u201d New York-based investment research firm CFRA\u2019s Garrett Nelson was quoted by MarketWatch at the time. \u201cAlthough Tesla used a relatively small percentage of their overall cash to make the purchase, it has investors questioning its future growth strategy.\u201d While the bitcoin purchase paid off for Tesla in the immediate term -- to the tune of about $1 billion in paper profits -- the move married Tesla\u2019s share prices to the value of Bitcoin, both of which took a nosedive soon thereafter.\u00a0 Then, just last month, Musk did a complete 180 on his long-held loyalty to Bitcoin. The Tesla CEO announced that the electric vehicles company would stop accepting Bitcoin as payment. The reason Musk cited had nothing to do with the cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility, nor his investors\u2019 cold feet, but instead focused on Bitcoin\u2019s significant and growing negative environmental externalities.\u00a0 Related: High Oil Prices Set Supermajors Up For A Promising Earnings Season The announcement came against the backdrop of increasing scrutiny and criticism of the cryptocurrency\u2019s massive energy consumption and expanding carbon footprint. Some of the vocal critics of Bitcoin and the threat it poses to fighting global warming include none other than that other really, really rich and influential tech guy Bill Gates. \"Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind,\u201d Gates was quoted by the New York Times back in April, a few short weeks before Musk\u2019s about-turn, as part of a high-profile takedown of the crypto-asset.\u00a0 Indeed, Bitcoin uses more energy each year than many entire countries. At 112.57 Terawatt hours per year, Bitcoin ranks between the Netherlands (110.68 Terawatt hours per year) and the United Arab Emirates (119.45 Terawatt hours per year). Altogether, Bitcoin miners represent a whopping 0.52% of the entire world\u2019s consumption.\u00a0 As part of Musk\u2019s newfound environmental priorities, he took part in putting together an entirely toothless Bitcoin Mining Council which has given itself the task of improving the cryptocurrency\u2019s sustainability following a meeting between prominent North American Bitcoin miners and Musk. The council is advocating for greater energy usage transparency and campaigning to get miners to switch over to renewable energy sources. Of course, the whole idea of giving recommendations and guidelines centering transparency to a group of people whose sole uniting values are decentralization, autonomy, and anonymity will be a lot like herding anarchist cats. All of which is to say: good luck with that. Finally, just this week, Musk has thrown more weight with far greater incentive behind the imperative, announcing (on Twitter -- where else?) that Tesla will once again begin to accept Bitcoin payments once the cryptocurrency runs on a rough minimum of 50% clean energy. Bitcoin stock enjoyed a significant boost in the immediate aftermath. Bitcoin and Musk\u2019s on-again off-again, will they or won\u2019t they romance is sure to enjoy more ups and downs and public volatility for the foreseeable future, so stay tuned. Or direct your attention instead to the more environmentally friendly and even more absurd Muskian prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Dogecoin, available now in an absurdist Twitter thread near you.\u00a0 By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com: The Best Oil Stocks As Prices Rebound Judge Blocks Biden\u2019s Ban On Oil Leasing $100 Oil Predictions Soar As Analysts Warn Of Supply Crisis Read this article on OilPrice.com "}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "German minister in talks with Tesla over sharing supercharger network ", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/german-minister-talks-tesla-over-164611306.html", "date": "Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:46:11 GMT", "content": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's transport minister is trying to convince Tesla to open its network of superchargers to other carmakers to make it easier for drivers of electric vehicles to charge.

(See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks) But environmental groups Gruene Liga and NABU have objected to that permit. The groups are concerned that the gigafactory will produce highly poisonous gas. They say Tesla has not sufficiently clarified the measures it will take to prevent the gas from escaping from the plant. Additionally, the groups say Tesla has not obtained the necessary permit to produce battery cells at the facility. The groups want state authorities to file for a suspension of Tesla\u2019s gigafactory permit by June 16, or else they will go to court. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney recently reiterated a Buy rating on Tesla stock with a price target of $860. The analyst\u2019s price target implies 41% upside potential. Delaney reiterated the bullish rating after Tesla began deliveries of the Model S Plaid, the advanced version of the Model S.

These freshly-submitted public filings disclose money managers\u2019 equity positions as of the end of the three-month period that ended March 31st, so let\u2019s proceed with the discussion of the hedge fund sentiment on Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) worth your attention right now? Prominent investors were getting less bullish. The number of bullish hedge fund bets were cut by 6 recently. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was in 62 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 68. Our calculations also showed that TSLA isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Hedge funds have more than $3.5 trillion in assets under management, so you can't expect their entire portfolios to beat the market by large margins. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). So you can still find a lot of gems by following hedge funds' moves today. Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management At Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, lithium mining is one of the fastest growing industries right now, so we are checking out stock pitches like this emerging lithium stock. We go through lists like the 10 best hydrogen fuel cell stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Keeping this in mind let's check out the key hedge fund action regarding Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). At the end of March, a total of 62 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -9% from one quarter earlier. On the other hand, there were a total of 61 hedge funds with a bullish position in TSLA a year ago. So, let's review which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves. More specifically, Citadel Investment Group was the largest shareholder of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), with a stake worth $16340.9 million reported as of the end of March. Trailing Citadel Investment Group was ARK Investment Management, which amassed a stake valued at $3864.3 million. PEAK6 Capital Management, Coatue Management, and D E Shaw were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Value Star Asset Management allocated the biggest weight to Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), around 29.58% of its 13F portfolio. Tao Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 11.09 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to TSLA. Judging by the fact that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has witnessed declining sentiment from the smart money, we can see that there is a sect of funds that slashed their entire stakes by the end of the first quarter. It's worth mentioning that Ben Levine, Andrew Manuel and Stefan Renold's LMR Partners sold off the biggest position of the \"upper crust\" of funds watched by Insider Monkey, comprising about $2056 million in stock, and D. E. Shaw's D E Shaw was right behind this move, as the fund dropped about $1654.4 million worth. These bearish behaviors are interesting, as total hedge fund interest was cut by 6 funds by the end of the first quarter. Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Tesla Inc.

(NYSE:JPM), Visa Inc (NYSE:V), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). This group of stocks' market valuations are closest to TSLA's market valuation.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 105.1 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $12984 million. That figure was $10013 million in TSLA's case. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the least popular one with only 58 bullish hedge fund positions. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for TSLA is 28.2. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th and surpassed the market again by 3.3 percentage points. Unfortunately TSLA wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); TSLA investors were disappointed as the stock returned -8.7% since the end of March (through 6/11) and underperformed the market.

(TSLA) has underperformed badly in the first half of 2021, posting a 12% year-to-date decline. Of course, that\u2019s no big deal after 2020\u2019s historic 839% return but don\u2019t tell that to shareholders who took exposure in December or the first quarter of this year. Those folks, in particular, should pay attention to the ticker tape in coming weeks because the stock has entered a critical phase that could dictate performance into 2022. The stakes are high because the current pattern is carving a bearish descending triangle that favors a breakdown and decline into November 2020\u2019s unfilled gap between 412 and 433. However, that prediction will come off the table if the rally that started in May can mount tough resistance centered at the 650 level. Fortunately for bulls, accumulation has remained strong since the stock topped out in January, giving them a good shot at blasting through that barrier. CEO Elon Musk\u2019s erratic comments about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t helping the stock\u2019s performance because many institutions have taken positions in the last year and are looking for conservative accounting that just isn\u2019t possible, given high volatility in digital assets. In addition, the company is now a SP-500 component that\u2019s been public for more than a decade, forcing them to compete for capital with other blue chips, rather than at-home speculators. Wall Street consensus is mixed after last year\u2019s outsized share gains, with a \u2018Hold\u2019 rating based upon 15 \u2018Buy\u2019, 1 \u2018Overweight\u2019, 11 \u2018Hold\u2019, and 3 \u2018Underweight\u2019 recommendations. More importantly, 6 of 36 analysts covering Tesla recommend that shareholders close positions and move to the sidelines. Price targets currently range from a low of $67 to a Street-high $1,471 while the stock is set to open Monday\u2019s session more than $100 below the median $725 target. Tesla mounted the February 2020 high at 193.80 in June, entering a multiwave uptrend that topped out above 900 in January 2021. The stock then sold off to the 200-day moving average at 558.79, marking the first leg in a descending triangle that will post a second lower high if the current uptick reverses at or below 650. A test at the trading floor in the mid-500s could easily fail if that happens, yielding a breakdown that potentially sheds an additional 125 to 150 points.

(NASDAQ: CVAC), may not be as fortunate as its domestic peer BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX), which along with its U.S. partner Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE), has found resounding success with its vaccine program. What Happened:  Results of the second interim analysis of CureVac\u2019s international Phase 2b/3 study of its first-generation vaccine candidate showed vaccine efficacy of 47% against COVID-19 disease of any severity, the German company said in a statement. The company also said the trial did not meet prespecified statistical success criteria. CureVac clarified that initial analysis suggested age and strain-dependent efficacy. In addition, the Data Safety Monitoring Board confirmed a favorable safety profile for the vaccine candidate, codenamed CVnCoV, it added. Out of the 134 COVID-19 cases assessed from a total study population of 40,000, only one case was attributable to the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and more than half of the cases were caused by variants of concern. In contrast, the remaining cases were caused by less characterized variants. The company said it had shared the data with the European Medicines Agency.

The FDA has recently revised vaccine review guidelines, deciding not to entertain EUA applications. Instead, the agency is now contemplating review only through the full approval process route, necessitating more detailed data. Incidentally, CureVac has a collaboration with Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) for vaccine printers. In early April, Elon Musk tweeted suggesting CureVac is \u201ca few months away from regulatory approval,\u201d but deleted it soon after. What\u2019s Next:  CureVac said it would continue with the final analysis of data from the study. Then, the totality of the data will be assessed for the most appropriate regulatory pathway. \u201cWhile we were hoping for a stronger interim outcome, we recognize that demonstrating high efficacy in this unprecedented broad diversity of variants is challenging. As we are continuing toward the final analysis with a minimum of 80 additional cases, the overall vaccine efficacy may change,\u201d said Dr. Franz-Werner Haas, CEO of CureVac. CureVac is also developing a second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE: GSK). These, according to the company, are based on mRNA technology and include potential variants in multivalent vaccine formats as well as combination vaccines for potential protection against multiple infectious diseases in one vaccine. CureVac is backed by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Price Action: CureVac shares, which debuted on the Nasdaq in Aug. 2020, have lost 38.30% to trade at $58.53 in the premarket session on the last check Thursday.

Still, the move to 2.5-week highs above $39,000 has failed to calm market fears. That\u2019s evident from a chart pattern known as the \u201coptions smile,\u201d which shows relatively higher implied volatility or demand for options at strikes below bitcoin\u2019s current market price than the implied volatility for higher strikes options. The unique structure speaks of extreme fears and continued demand for downside hedges, as tweeted by trader and analyst Alex Kruger. In plain English, investors continue to buy puts in anticipation of a more profound price decline. Related: Market Wrap: Bitcoin Sustains &#8216;Musk Jump&#8217; as Crypto Sentiment Improves Options smile, a U-shaped graph resembling a smiley emoticon, is created by plotting implied volatilities against options at various strike prices expiring on the same date. Implied volatility is investors\u2019 expectations of price turbulence over a specific period. A higher implied volatility results from greater demand for options and vice versa. Options are hedging instruments that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents the right to buy and put the right to sell. Options smile for the June 15 and June 18 expiries charted by analytics platform Genesis Volatility is quite steep at strikes well below bitcoin\u2019s current price and relatively flat on the higher side. The subsequent expiries due on June 25, July 2 and July 30 exhibit similar structures. The steeper slope at lower strikes reflects fears of a sell-off and the flatter slope at the right end shows market participants expect rallies, if any, to be gradual. Related: Bitcoin and Ether Price Indicators Support Near-Term &#8216;Relief Rally&#8217; One may argue that the steeper slope at lower strikes could be stemming from increased demand for call options or bullish bets than for protective puts. However, put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, suggest otherwise. The one-week, one- and three-month put-call skews remain entrenched in the positive territory, implying stronger demand for short- and near-term puts. Had the market participants been buying in-the-money calls, or even higher strike (out-of-the-money) calls in large numbers, the put-call skews would have been negative. Deep-in-the-money calls \u2013 ones at strikes well below the spot \u2013 are relatively costly and eliminate the low risk-high reward advantage provided by calls at higher strikes. As such, in calls, hedging/trading activity is almost always concentrated at strikes just below the spot price, near the spot price and above the spot price, while in the case of puts, activity is mostly seen in strikes near and below the spot price. That seems to be the case with bitcoin as well. Data from dominant exchange Deribit tracked by the Swiss-based Laevitas platform shows a relatively high concentration of open interest (number of open positions) in out-of-the-money and at-the-money calls and lower strike puts. While the market remains cautious for the short term, the longer-term bias looks bullish. The volatility smile for the Dec. 31 expiry options carries a steep slope for higher strikes.

The company has a business-to-business strategy, recycling the scrap from battery cell production as well as consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. Redwood collects the scrap from consumer electronics companies and battery cell manufacturers like Panasonic. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and then supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers. The aim is to create a closed loop system that will ultimately help reduce the cost of batteries and offset the need for mining. Redwood Materials has a number of customers, and has only publicly disclosed that it is working with Panasonic, Amazon and AESC Envision in Tennessee Redwood Materials says it recovers about 95% to 98% of the elements from the batteries such as nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper.

The factory will be located on a 400-acre site in the MidAmerica Industrial Park in Pryor, Oklahoma about 45 minutes from Tulsa. The facility, which the company describes as a \"mega microfactory\" will include a paint shop, body shop and general assembly plant and is expected to open in 2023. The site is near a number of manufacturing and logistics businesses, Aquila noted. \"It's a hub that we think is going to grow like crazy,\" Aquila said at the event. \"In addition to that, it puts you dead center for logistics and movement across North America, so you can get anywhere, same day and back is pretty important.\" Canoo, which has said it will deliver its first EV in the fourth quarter of 2022, also announced it is partnering with Netherlands-based contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar to handle initial production while the factory is being built. Canoo's announcement comes nearly a year after Oklahoma lost its bid to convince Tesla to build its next factory in the state. Tesla ultimately picked a site near Austin for the factory, which it has said will produce the Cybertruck, the Tesla Semi and the Model Y and Model 3 for sales to customers on the East Coast. Tesla picks Austin for its next US factory to build Cybertruck, Semi truck, Model Y \"We're super pumped \u2014 we think we are the flavor of the month and we are the right place for manufacturing,\" Gov.

Canoo's investor day featured a variety of engineers, designers and executives, all of whom focused on certain aspects of the company's vision. Canoo is focused on products for consumers and commercial customers. All of Canoo's EVs will share the same skateboard and use different cabins or \"top hats\" that can be paired to create unique vehicles. The company has unveiled several vehicles, including an electric microbus, a pickup and one designed for business-to-business applications. The company has scaled up its workforce to about 435 people as of the end of the first quarter of 2021, and plans to expand to 690 people by the end of the year, according to CTO Pete Savagian. It was also the first major public event with Aquila steering the company that has had a bumpy ride in the past year. Canoo started as Evelozcity in 2017, founded by former Faraday Future executives Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. The company rebranded as Canoo in spring 2019 and debuted its first vehicle several months later. The unique-looking vehicle and Canoo's initial plan to offer it only as a subscription helped the company gain the attention of investors and the media. Canoo even landed a partnership with Hyundai to co-develop EVs, but that deal fell apart earlier this year after the company changed its business model and decided to not offer engineering services to other automakers, according to comments made in March by Aquila. Canoo also lost its co-founders, first Krause, and more recently Kranz. And in May, the company disclosed that it is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigation is broad and covers the special purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp.'s initial public offering and merger with Canoo, the company's operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings and other related topics, along with the recent departures of certain of the company's officers, according to a quarterly earnings report posted May 17.

While the first name that pops into our heads when we think of EVs is Tesla TSLA, it would not be wrong to believe that the legacy U.S. auto giant General Motors GM may soon overtake Tesla if it continues with aggressive and ambitious e-mobility strides. Indeed, Tesla transformed the EV market much the same way as Amazon AMZN changed the retail landscape and Netflix NFLX revolutionized entertainment. But the EV king might just be slowly losing its first-mover advantage. Consumers now have many options, with various EV models in the market at similar price and range levels. Competition in the EV landscape is heating up, with new models being launched and more and more auto biggies reorienting their business model to keep up with the changing dynamics of the industry. Legacy automakers are pouring vast sums of money to ramp up investment in eco-friendly vehicles. General Motors is one stock that seems to be hitting all the right notes and is expected to make the most of out of the electrified future. General Motors is going the extra mile to put the pedal to the metal toward e-mobility future. A couple of days back, the company boosted electric and driverless investment to $35 billion through 2025, up from $27 billion proposed in November 2020. In the words of the company\u2019s CEO Mary Barra, \u201cWe are investing aggressively in a comprehensive and highly-integrated plan to make sure that GM leads in all aspects of the transformation to a more sustainable future\u201d, taking on Musk\u2019s claims to maintain its leadership position when it comes to EV development. Part of the additional investment would be allocated toward the establishment of two new battery plants. General Motors plans to set up two new battery cell manufacturing plants in the United States by mid-decade,\u00a0in addition to facilities in Ohio and Tennessee. These factories will not just serve General Motors\u2019 EV requirements but also supply battery cells to Honda and Wabtec. In addition to the collaboration with Honda to co-build two new all electric vehicles (based on the Ultium platform) for the Japan-based giant, General Motors recently partnered with Wabtec for the supply of the Ultium battery technology and Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell systems for Wabtec freight locomotives. General Motors targets worldwide EV sales of more than 1 million annually by 2025. Last November, it announced plans to roll out 30 EVs globally by 2025. The vehicles will encompass the company\u2019s entire brand portfolio including Cadillac, Buick, GMC and Chevrolet in varying prices. The firm\u2019s own modular battery platform, Ultium Drive system, will aid in the transition to an all-electric portfolio down the road. Importantly, GMC Hummer all-electric pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq SUV are scheduled to go on sale in late 2021 and first-quarter 2022, respectively. With the latest ramped up investments, the company is set to develop new electric commercial trucks, details of which will be announced later. Also, General Motors intends to add capacity to U.S. assembly factories for electric SUVs. Basically, its \u201call-in\u201d electrification strategy to gain a competitive edge in batteries, software, vehicle integration, manufacturing and customer experience will make EVs the key catalyst for boosting the company\u2019s profitability.

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Friday, June 18, 2021 We're less than a week out from the halfway point of 2021.\u00a0 And one of the big real economy stories this year has been the explosion in demand for cars. This has pushed up prices, particularly for used cars.\u00a0 And while most used cars, and those on the road today, are running on internal combustion engines (ICE), the industry agrees that electric vehicles (EVs) are the future. For the last decade, the best way to play that trend has been via Tesla (TSLA). Shareholders in that particular trade have been rewarded handsomely: since June 2011, the car maker's shares are up over 10,000%.\u00a0 This year, however, investors have been betting that the industry's old guard can make their businesses work better in an electrified future.\u00a0 Through Thursday's close, shares of Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) were both up more than 40%, outpacing both the broader market and all of the market's buzziest names in the EV space.\u00a0 At an industry conference on Thursday, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company's second quarter earnings were likely to come in better than expected. Earlier this week, GM announced that it would increase its investment in electric vehicles to $35 billion from $27 billion through 2025.\u00a0 And it was only a few weeks back that Ford announced its own ambitious plans to electrify more of its fleet, unveiling an electric F-150, its best-selling ICE vehicle, while unveiling plans to invest $30 billion in electric vehicle development over the next five years. This year's rally in shares of GM and Ford also remind us (in yet another way) how different this recovery has been from what we endured after the financial crisis.\u00a0 GM and Chrysler went bankrupt during the 2008-09 recession; Ford just barely staved off that fate. This time around, these companies are parlaying a surge in consumer demand into increased investments in trying to keep up with the Teslas of the world.\u00a0 These announcements out of Ford and GM also come as upstart competitors like Nikola (NKLA) and Lordstown Motors (RIDE) struggle to accurately communicate with investors. Nikola shares, which fell over 50% in 2020, were up about 11% this year through Thursday's close, while Lordstown's stock has been just about cut in half this year. Both Nikola and Lordstown replaced their chief executives after bold pronouncements about orders and capabilities for their vehicles didn't check out.\u00a0 Elon Musk's iconoclastic style at Tesla is much imitated but never duplicated by companies hoping to position themselves as the \"next Tesla.\" Tesla's Technoking really is one of one.\u00a0\u00a0 In the years before the pandemic, Tesla's rise and the industry's electrified future pressured shares of Ford, GM, and other automakers. From the time GM emerged from bankruptcy in the fall of 2010, shares of both GM and Ford were trounced by the overall market. This year's gain does not erase that underperformance. And the lead the traditional auto industry has staked on Tesla becoming the leading electric vehicle brand will be hard to overcome.\u00a0 But today, what investors seem to see in Ford and GM is at least a chance. A chance to benefit from the post-pandemic economic expansion. And a chance at remaining a major player in the electrified auto market of tomorrow.\u00a0 By Myles Udland, reporter and anchor for Yahoo Finance Live.

The two companies intend to compete with some of the leading names in the EV and self-driving vehicles sector. America\u2019s largest automaker General Motors is in a race to close the gap in the electric vehicle sector and catch up to the likes of Tesla. For this reason, the company announced that it is raising its spending on electric and autonomous vehicles to $35 billion through 2025. This latest development represents a 30% increase from its 2020 plans. Per the company, the extra funds would be used to expand GM\u2019s rollout of EVs and boost the production of its battery and fuel cell technologies. GM intends to build two new battery plants in the United States in addition to two that are currently under construction. The extra investment would allow GM to catch up to industry leader Tesla and fight for leadership in the industry against the likes of Volkswagen. The company projects to sell over a million EVs annually by 2025. GM\u2019s stock price is performing excellently at Wednesday\u2019s pre-market trading session. It is currently up by 1.38% and could rise further once the market opens. GM CEO Mary Barra said the move to electric vehicles is to ensure that the company transforms to a more sustainable future. The autonomous vehicle industry should expect more competition after Google sibling company Waymo announced earlier today that it had raised $2.5 billion in the latest funding round. The funds would be used to advance its autonomous driving technology and grow its team. The self-driving car industry has struggled to hit the ground running as adoption has been low so far. However, Waymo expects to turn things around and achieve the desired growth. So far, Waymo\u2019s delivery unit, Waymo Via, is being used by freight partners and delivery clients like UPS to deliver goods. The company is already using its autonomous vehicles as a ride-hailing service in Phoenix. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s stock price is down by 0.048% at Wednesday\u2019s pre-market trading session, which might suggest the market is not so thrilled about the Waymo progress.

Several state governments have also provided subsidies for EVs. This is because EVs are environment-friendly, responsible for lesser noise and have a low maintenance cost. Several countries this year have pledged to reduce carbon emissions. Companies like Amazon and salesforce.com are also aiming to be carbon-neutral soon. Needless to say, companies can easily lower emissions by electrifying their fleet. FedEx, in particular, mentioned that electrifying its fleet will largely help the company reach carbon neutrality by 2040. Thus, with several companies aiming to reach carbon neutrality in the near term, the demand for EVs is soaring at the moment. In fact, notable traditional carmakers have now joined the EV bandwagon. For instance, players like General Motors Company GM, Ford Motor Company F and Volkswagen have now started to venture into the EV market. Ford\u2019s F-150 EV is the latest to have an impact on the auto industry. Similarly, General Motors and Volkswagen are set to launch new battery-electric vehicles in the near future. By the way, EV battery sales increased handsomely in the first four months of the year, buoying companies like Tesla, Inc. TSLA and Nikola. Apart from this, wireless charging mechanisms coupled with turbo-charges for EVs are having an overall positive impact on the EV market. In fact, the EV market is now well-poised to expand, and as per Facts and Factors, citing a globenewswire article, the global EV market is projected to touch $700 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 22% from 2021 to 2026. Additionally, another globenewswire article stated that Market Research Future expects the global EV market to see a CAGR of 21.6% from 2021 to touch $893.5 billion by 2027. What\u2019s more, the Boston Consulting Group already projected that EVs will more or less account for a third of the global auto industry by 2025, and more than 50% by 2030, easily surpassing sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) companies. From rising concerns about CO2 emission, encouraging government policies to considerable investments by EV manufacturers, the global EV market is well-positioned to expand in the near future. An increase in initiatives to provide charging facilities in many areas and active involvement by original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in the EV space should contribute toward its growth trends. We have, thus, highlighted three solid EV stocks that are well-positioned to gain from this growing industry. Tesla has played a pivotal role in transforming the EV market, the same way Amazon did to the retail landscape. By selling EV cars, Tesla is actually compelling the world to rely more on sustainable energy. In the United States, Tesla is one of the dominant players in the EV space and has made sure that EVs are now available for all and not just the affluent. Tesla currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.5% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 92.9%. For the next five-year period, shares of Tesla are expected to gain 37.5%. General Motors is now spending billions of dollars on EV vehicles to establish itself as a dominant player in the EV market. Citing a Barron\u2019s article, General Motors is aiming to spend $35 billion on EVs during the period 2021 to 2025. The article further noted that General Motors aims to sell 1 million EVs each year by 2025. In fact, General Motors aspires to be an all-EV seller by 2035. General Motors currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 7.5% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 11.6%. For the next five-year period, shares of General Motors are expected to gain 9.9%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Ford, in the meantime, has also raised its spending on EVs. Citing one of the abcnews articles, Ford declared that its Lincoln luxury brand would be electric by 2030. Ford currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 6.3% over the past 30 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 146.3%. For the next five-year period, shares of Ford are expected to gain 21.8%. From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Invest in 2021. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency in the world that has registered a sharp decrease in price over the past few weeks, was given a much needed boost on June 9 after El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt the coin as legal tender. Nayib Bukele, the 39-year-old president of the country, supported the tender and has argued that the cryptocurrency will jumpstart the economy, help with remittance transfers, and improve the banking penetration rate in the country.  Bitcoin, which had fallen to below $30,000 in April, rallied after the bill regarding the mainstreaming of the coin was approved by lawmakers, climbing to around $38,000, but was still far below the record $64,000 touched before the freefall started two months ago. The cryptocurrency has been hit in recent weeks by criticism on energy intensive mining methods and a regulatory crackdown in China. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) chief Elon Musk has been one of the most powerful voices on the issue on social media.  Since Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is one of the largest institutional backers of Bitcoin, the public criticism has battered the cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin fell, other crypto-related stocks, like Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) and Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) also pulled back from record highs, fueling speculation around the future of cryptocurrencies. However, despite the bear market, hedge funds have been piling into crypto stocks like Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) and Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) in recent months. The general outlook on the industry remains positive, with market experts, money managers, and technology officers of big corporations mostly bullish on the future of cryptocurrencies in general and the future of Bitcoin in particular. Ethereum, the second most popular crypto coin, is being touted as the next big breakaway start of the industry. Other altcoins like Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and Cardano have been making strides as well. Retail investor interest, which is shaping market dynamics in this regard, is often touted as the key to this digital revolution.  Cryptocurrencies have also spearheaded the rise of fintech, a disruptor in the finance world that even established institutions have struggled to cope with. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn\u2019t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey\u2019s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter\u2019s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That\u2019s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

CME\u2019s strategic positioning as a monopolistic global financial exchange operator will continue to afford the business a highly attractive margin profile. CME is well managed however we can no longer identify clear value latency opportunities for the management team to execute against and so decided to exit our position.\u201d Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a technology company that concentrates on the development of computer and mobile hardware. The powerful chipsets marketed by the company are used in mining operations around the world.

NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are at the intersection of a number of important computing trends including the movement to the Cloud, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, edge computing, gaming, and more. We previously owned NVIDIA and sold it in the third quarter of 2020 as the price to value gap closed and our margin of safety was reduced. As with all our MVP companies, we continued to follow NVIDIA closely. Since that time, NVIDIA reported excellent results and its value has compounded rapidly.

For obvious reasons, people shifted to contactless payments\u2014one of the Covid-era changes we think is permanent\u2014and replaced travel purchases with online shopping and food delivery. Consumers spent more on their debit cards and less on their credit cards; Visa and Mastercard make more per transaction on the latter. They also make more on cross-border transactions that come mostly from international travel, which ground to a halt early in the pandemic. Visa\u2019s and Mastercard\u2019s earnings per share fell by 7% and 16%, respectively, compared to their usual mid-teens growth. We\u2019re not too worried, and we think they\u2019ll catch up nicely in the post-vaccine world.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, finished the day in the red. Investors were bullish on tech stocks today, including the likes of Netflix and Apple as well as growth stock Tesla, all of which helped to fuel the Nasdaq to gains. Investors are trading with an eye toward this week\u2019s Fed meeting, which gets underway on Tuesday. Netflix gained more than 2% Apple gained 2.4% Tesla gained slightly more than 1% Elon Musk is probably one of the only CEOs who have the ability to move not one but two markets. After revealing that Tesla will bring BTC payments back once about half of bitcoin mining originates from clean energy sources, Musk managed to fuel gains in the cryptocurrency market and Tesla stock. According to Unigestion\u2019s Salman Baig cited by The Wall Street Journal, stocks still have more upside potential despite the fact that markets are trading at record levels. Much will depend on what the Fed has to say this week. While policymakers are likely to keep interest rates unchanged for now, the economy is beginning to operate on all cylinders, with both stocks and housing prices at all-time highs. Future rate hikes could be in the cards and may come faster and more furiously than expected. AMC Entertainment topped the list as the most actively traded stock today. Shares of the movie chain gained 15%, catapulting the stock nearer to the USD 60 threshold it saw earlier this month. AMC had trading volume of 296 million shares, which is more than twice the stock\u2019s average. Clover Health also made it onto the most actively traded list today, but mostly for selling volume. Shares of the recently added meme stock fell about 2.5% in today\u2019s session after last week\u2019s bull run in which its value ballooned by 26%. Meme stock newcomer Corsair Gaming added more than 11% today and is up in after-hours trading as well. Investors welcomed the stock onto the WallStreetBets Reddit forum and are hoping a bullish gaming industry narrative will keep the momentum going on Tuesday. On the economic front, Retail Sales for May come out on Tuesday with a median forecast for a fractional decline, though nothing too alarming. Industrial Production for May will be released on the heels of the retail sales data. And of course, all eyes are on the Fed.

MicroStrategy, in its latest move signaling support for bitcoin, will sell up to $1 billion of its stock to buy the asset. The company published the relevant SEC form on June 14. CEO Michel Saylor, now one of bitcoin\u2019s strongest proponents, also revealed the development on Twitter. MicroStrategy has been consistently doubling down on its bitcoin bet, having made a considerable return on investment on its bitcoin purchases with the bull run in the first few months of 2021. Clearly, the company and its leading figure are betting on bitcoin to grow moving forward. The company is one that sticks to its word. Just yesterday, on June 14, it sold $500 million in secured notes to buy roughly 11,900 BTC. The news pushed the stock price of MicroStrategy by 12%. MicroStrategy\u2019s interest in bitcoin goes beyond just purchasing BTC and sitting on the asset. The company\u2019s CEO is involving himself in more educational and awareness efforts, including the launch of a Bitcoin Mining Council. Recently, Saylor announced that the newly launched Bitcoin Mining Council would have a meeting on June 16 to discuss bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption and possible green energy solutions. Notably, Elon Musk will not be a part of the mining council, though he has held a call related to the council in the past. Musk\u2019s tweets set off a storm of headlines related to bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption, which subsequently sent the cryptocurrency\u2019s price tanking. The Tesla CEO said that the company would stop accepting bitcoin payments for Teslas until mining switched to cleaner sources of energy. Recently, he updated the status on this by saying that if there was confirmation of approximately 50% of mining using clean energy, as well as a \u201cpositive future trend,\u201d Tesla would start accepting bitcoin again. This helped bitcoin\u2019s price up, on top of the approval of the Taproot upgrade for the network. The Bitcoin Mining Council itself is an organization composed loosely of individuals, groups, and miners that will focus on bringing positive changes to mining on the network. The FAQ on the council\u2019s page goes so far as to say that it will not involve Elon Musk, assuaging the market\u2019s concerns on the Tesla CEO, which it has grown upset with.

The stock has also reached a significant milestone that could qualify it to trade in the same index as some technology behemoths including Apple, Amazon, Facebook and even Tesla \u2014 the Russell 1000. GameStop needed to have a market cap of USD 5.2 billion as of May 7 to be eligible, a standard that it passed with flying colors. On that date, its value was roughly USD 12 billion. The Russell 1000 index is reportedly set to be reorganized on June 25. To be fair, GameStop\u2019s weighting would likely be small in comparison to the tech giants. Still, should GameStop gain entry into this popular index, it could provide some long-term stability to the stock price. That is because index funds are a popular choice in retirement accounts via ETFs or mutual funds. As a result, GME could become part of the portfolio of many future retirees who might otherwise not hopped on the meme-stock bandwagon. When Tesla joined the Russell 1000 more than a decade ago, the stock was trading at less than USD 5 per share. Today the stock is trading at more than USD 616 per share. That\u2019s not to say that the stock\u2019s bull run has been a function of its membership in the Russell index. But it is a good sign and an indication of how beneficial it can be to be part of the index club. In addition, Tesla recently joined the S&P 500 index on Dec. 21, 2020. To join the S&P 500, a stock must boast a market cap of at least USD 11.8 billion as one of the criteria. GameStop meets that criteria with a market cap of more than USD 16 billion. Perhaps it won\u2019t be long before the market is talking about GME not only joining another Russell index (it currently trades in the smaller-cap Russell 2000) but also the benchmark U.S. stock market index, the S&P 500. Meme stocks have proven to be some of the best bets of the year. Stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment have gone parabolic and gained comparisons to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. On the commodities front, lumber has shed more than 40% of its value since hitting a multi-year high in early May. The gold price has managed to rise a modest 1.6% since then. GameStop shares are tacking on more than 1% today on the index chatter.

Despite the continuous tussle between growth and value stocks, the fact is that investing in growth stocks with strong fundamentals and long-term potential remains the best way to make profits. Technology companies account for 40% of the S&P 500. Growth stocks account for a huge part of the total returns generated by the broader indices over the last several years. The baffling returns posted by stocks like Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB), Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) over the past few years have shown the power of companies that are working on products of consequential value. Major tech companies and growth stocks like Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB), Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) continue to have surprisingly high valuations and metrics. This is because these companies are working on products and services that have a huge demand in the market. Despite the raucous around soaring valuations, several analysts believe that the rise of tech stocks and their valuations is justified on the back of their spectacular earnings growth, exponential increase in customers and eye-popping spending for future growth. Janus Henderson Investors\u2019 Alison Porter said in an interview with Wall Street Journal that the \u201cdigital lifestyle\u201d people are embracing especially after the pandemic is providing further boost to these tech stocks. Porter likes some of the biggest technology companies because of their growth and increasing user base. Baffling growth of growth stocks have also surprised the smart money, which has now started piling into these stocks. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn\u2019t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey\u2019s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017.

On May 25, Tesla, a U.S. electric vehicle company, announced that it would not use millimeter-wave radar in its Autopilot autonomous driving assistance system. The leading car company in autonomous driving technology will adopt a more audacious autonomous sensing solution. Environmental sensing is one of the core technologies of autonomous driving, and sensing and recognition cannot be achieved without sensors such as cameras, millimeter-wave radar and LiDAR. At present, there are two main solutions to the sensing technology of autonomous driving. One is visual computing with Tesla as a typical representative. This technology is composed of low-cost components such as millimeter-wave radar with camera as the dominant component. The other is composed of components such as camera and millimeter-wave radar with LiDAR as the dominant component. \"The former solution dominated by vision has low cost and is easy to massively produce, while the latter one dominated by LiDAR has the strength of accurate measurement but its cost is rather high. Both solutions have their own strengths and weaknesses,\" Yang Diange, a professor at School of Vehicle and Mobility Tsinghua University, said in an interview with a reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald. Tesla prefers the vision solution and its CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly defamed LiDAR in public, even so, there are still many car companies that regard LiDAR technology as the preferred solution to achieve higher-level autonomous driving. This year, a number of Chinese car companies have announced their plans for mass production of onboard LiDAR. Is LiDAR needed at this stage? The automotive-grade LiDAR has been developed for some time. In 2017, Valeo produced its first automotive-grade LiDAR for the Audi A8 massively. On May 31 of the same year, Gu Jianmin, CTO of Valeo China, told the reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald that Valeo had produced and delivered nearly 130 thousand LiDARs worldwide. It is understood that Valeo will massively produce LiDAR to install it on Nissan Legend model in March this year. In addition, Valeo\u2019s second generation LiDAR will be installed on the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class model and on another car company's models by mass production in Asia next year. However, Valeo's LiDAR has not been fully equipped on mass-produced vehicles, and it is only installed on some versions of some models. When the NIO ET7, Xiaopeng P5 and Alpha S models were launched, NIO, Xiaopeng and ArcFox all claimed to be the first to be equipped with mass-produced LiDAR. The models of the three car companies have been unveiled in the first half of this year and are scheduled to be delivered at the end of the year or in the first quarter of next year. It is worth noting that more and more car companies have announced this year that they are going to adopt LiDAR. However, some car companies did not have LiDAR in their previous model design plans. Moreover, the assistant driving mode of some car companies does not need LiDAR. The mass production and application of LiDAR is closely related to the technological development of autonomous driving. There is a general consensus in the industry that LiDAR is unnecessary for the L1 and L2 autonomous driving models and it will increase the cost. Nonetheless, for L3, L4 and higher-level autonomous driving models, whether it is necessary to use LiDAR is still a matter of controversy. In simple terms, the biggest use of LiDAR at present is to improve the sensing accuracy of autonomous driving in extreme weather and extreme conditions. Currently, the mass production and application of LiDAR still face difficulties and challenges. Three essential conditions must be met for equipping mass-produced self-driving car with LiDAR: ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles, reaching automotive grade and keeping mass-produced costs under control. In terms of cost, as the technology maturing and the scale expanding, most LiDAR companies now claim that their mass production costs have reached about US$1,000. Different from them, Wang Jun, president of Huawei Smart Car Solutions BU, previously said that the cost of its LiDAR could be reduced to $200 in an interview during Shanghai Auto Show this year. But he did not reveal exactly when the cost could be reduced to this. However, from the perspective of laws and regulations, L3 and higher level autonomous vehicles can only be driven in autonomous driving test areas or demonstration areas, high-level autonomous driving has not reached the requirements for obtaining permission of driving in complex roads in urban areas. Therefore, from the current stage, whether car companies need to equip mass-produced vehicles with LiDAR still needs to be considered in terms of various issues such as cost and the operational environment. 100 billion yuan market investment opportunity In accordance with the predicted data of investment institutions, by 2025, the value of global LiDAR market will reach $12.6 billion and that of the Chinese LiDAR market will reach $4.31 billion. By 2025, three out of every 100 private cars in China will be equipped with LiDAR. The development of autonomous driving technology has also made LiDAR a new industrial investment opportunity. In the second half of last year, startups such as Velodyne and Luminar listed on US stocks one after another. As a holographic AR company listed on Nasdaq, WiMi Hologram Cloud has received cumulative investments of $170 million from well-known institutions such as Weibo since its IPO in April 2020, so it has sufficient capital to realize the expansion of the holographic AR industry to establish a vigorous competitive strength.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Penny Stocks Robinhood Traders are Buying in 2021. Robinhood Markets, the California-based financial technology firm that owns popular stock trading application Robinhood, is expected to debut on the stock market in the coming months, targeting a record market valuation of over $40 billion. Robinhood has gained prominence in the past few months as millions of new investors use the platform, primarily because it offers commission-free stock trading services, does not have a minimum account balance requirement, and has made trading essentially hassle-free. The application was developed by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt to unleash the micro-investor potential that had been bubbling away under the surface of the financial world for years but was held back by exuberant transaction fees and minimum investment requirements on the open market. In 2014, more than 300,000 people signed up for the application before launch. By 2015, this number had more than doubled. In May 2020, the New York Times claimed that Robinhood had 13 million active users. Over the past year, 3 million more have joined.  The average age of these users is around 30 and most bet on penny stocks with explosive growth potential. However, the interest in penny stocks does not hold them back from short-term plays on large-cap or mega-cap growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG). Through the month of May, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the most popular stock on the application by a country mile with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) also featured.  However, penny stocks still remain some of the most traded on the application in terms of volume. The technology, biopharma, and marijuana industries are some of the markets that these retail investors seem most interested in, with most popular penny stocks falling in one of these three categories. Robinhood has been thriving off these trends, generating more than $680 million in revenue last year, a more than 500% increase compared to 2019, as the coronavirus lockdowns dramatically increased interest in digital trading.  The larger trends towards digital and fintech are expected to continue driving market trends in the coming months, further pummeling the traditional finance world that has been hit hard by tech-led disruption. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn\u2019t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices.

Amid a sharp decline in the announcements of record-breaking auction results and high-profile sales, it seems hard to deny that the initial hype is fading fast. Yet, jumping to this conclusion ignores the fact that artists and other creatives are still swarming platforms. Sure, the absence of publicity might be taken as a sign that the speculation craze is over, but NFT demand hasn\u2019t necessarily stalled. It has simply migrated to more environmentally-friendly platforms, all without the fanfare. (See Bitcoin Stock Comparison on TipRanks) Seeking A More Sustainable Route The outsized environmental footprint of proof-of-work blockchains has been castigated time and time again. Even NFT artists and creators have grown more vocal in lamenting its tremendous impact. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) (or \u201cTechno-King of Tesla,\u201d as Musk prefers) thrust the energy consumption conversation back into the spotlight with his announcement that Tesla had suspended the acceptance of Bitcoin. Although it is difficult to call his comments a source of causation, NFT stakeholders have in many ways embraced less energy-intensive platforms. A look at the numbers show that stakeholders are simply shifting to other venues. Data compiled by NFT research group NonFungible.com indicates that both the number of sales and amount of active wallets for corresponding NFT platforms operating on the Ethereum blockchain have tumbled in recent weeks. Ethereum-based platforms have attempted to remedy the environmental reality by highlighting their use of carbon offset credits during auctions. Some, like Ethernity Chain, make social and environmental responsibility a part of their appeal. Still, that hasn\u2019t been enough to turn the tides. Take, for instance, Tezos-based NFT platform Hic Et Nunc. Just by the measure of daily active users, this platform has displaced OpenSea, Ethereum\u2019s largest competing NFT platform. The platform has already minted over 100,000 NFTs since launch and boasted more than 7,000 artists as of mid-May. Moreover, the fact that Tezos\u2019 proof-of-stake blockchain consumes just a staggeringly tiny fraction of comparable proof-of-work blockchains is helping shift the conversation. Many environmental activist artists are recognizing this serious difference and migrating their work accordingly. Simply Correlation, Not Necessarily Causation Whether or not this shift is the function of Musk\u2019s comments is difficult to qualify, but given the rise of other NFT platforms on competing blockchains, there might indeed be a relationship. If nothing else, it shows that the artists committed to reducing their environmental impact are making a change by voting with their feet. They have been joining the platforms that embrace and espouse their own principles. The one facet that remains unchallenged is the fact that NFTs are experiencing an adoption boom, especially in terms of attracting creatives. These developments just might increasingly be hidden from the industry\u2019s headlines as attention-grabbing auctions fade from the spotlight.

The revolution was short-lived. See: 10 Best Cryptocurrencies To Invest in for 2021Find Out: Dogecoin: Is It Still Worth an Investment? What is often left out of the discussion about Bitcoin is how terrible it is for the environment. The powerful, specialized computers that are needed to mine Bitcoin gobble up enormous amounts of energy, which is why most of it is mined in China, where electricity is dirt cheap and regulations are lax. Tesla \u2014 a company whose entire brand is rooted in sustainable energy \u2014 dropped its Bitcoin bid about three months later. Musk cited environmental concerns and the huge volume of fossil fuels that must be burned to produce a single coin. On May 12, Musk\u2019s mea culpa wiped $365 billion from the cryptocurrency market in a single day. Read: Why Some Money Experts Believe In Bitcoin and Others Don\u2019t But not all companies share Musk\u2019s concern with green energy. Bitcoin is big and getting bigger, with some of the biggest corporations in America jumping on the bandwagon and accepting Bitcoin as payment. Here are the top 10 players in the game.  Last updated: May 17, 2021 Microsoft became an early adopter of Bitcoin in 2014 when it began accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for games, apps and other digital content for platforms like Windows Phone and Xbox. Bitcoin was still largely unknown in 2014 and many of those who were familiar heard about it for all the wrong reasons. It was a year of drama and scandal, with the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, collapsing into bankruptcy after a flurry of frauds, hacks and incidents that saw hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins lost. At that time, a bar in New York City accepted Bitcoin, so did a few car services and restaurants, but very few other major companies to speak of \u2014 except for two.  Discover: Google, Microsoft Beat Earnings Estimates Thanks To Cloud Services, Ad Revenue If anyone was going to beat Microsoft to the punch, it makes sense that it would be the company that blazed the trail for modern digital payments. Microsoft began accepting Bitcoin at the end of 2014 in December \u2014 three months after PayPal got on board in September. Back then, Bitcoin was trading as XBT instead of BTC. As a testament to how unfamiliar the concept was then, CNN described Bitcoin as \u201can independent, government-less currency.\u201d PayPal\u2019s move was intended to draw businesses to its platform, not consumers. That draw was that Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees were far lower than the profit-killing 2%-3% charge that businesses were paying for credit card transactions. In the News: Elon Musk Sends Doge Prices on a Rollercoaster After Tesla Drops Bitcoin Before Microsoft went crypto, and even before PayPal, Overstock.com was blazing the trail that those giants would follow. As early as 2018, CNN was reporting that Overstock was \u201cbasically a crypto company now,\u201d an exaggeration based on the online retailer\u2019s heavy investment in blockchain technology. By that time \u2014 before COVID boosted Overstock to its current status as one of the hottest e-commerce platforms in the world \u2014 it was already a Bitcoin veteran. In January 2014 \u2014 a full nine months before PayPal took the plunge in September of that same year and nearly a year before Microsoft \u2014 Overstock became the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin as payment. Economy Explained: Breaking Down the Basics of Cryptocurrency In May 2019, a cryptocurrency dam broke when a payments startup called Flexa joined forces with Gemini, a digital currency company owned by the Facebook-famous Winklevoss twins. The partnership\u2019s platform allowed big retailers to incorporate Flexa into the digital scanners they were already using to accept phone-based payments through Apple Pay and other digital wallets. The technology instantly converted Bitcoins into dollars for seamless purchases. One of the first of those big retailers to adopt the technology was Whole Foods. Whole Foods is owned by Amazon, but Amazon itself does not, as of now, accept Bitcoin for purchases made through the world\u2019s largest online retailer.  Find Out: What Are Altcoins \u2014 and Are the Potential Rewards Worth the Risks? Etsy itself doesn\u2019t have a platform for accepting Bitcoin as payment sitewide, but the independent sellers who populate its platform can accept crypto in their individual shops if they choose. It\u2019s up to the seller to add an \u201cother\u201d payment method option at checkout. When buyers click that option, they\u2019ll be able to message the buyer with their payment preferences \u2014 Bitcoin, in this case. The seller then responds with a Bitcoin address to complete the transaction. The Etsy Community forum has a special page dedicated to Bitcoin with tutorials that explain how sellers can advertise that they accept Bitcoin and how to make the process go smoothly.

Like Etsy, Starbucks dipped its toes in the water instead of diving right into accepting crypto as cash. You can\u2019t pay for your Frappuccinos with Bitcoin at the register, but you can add Bitcoin \u2014 along with things like gift card balances and frequent-flyer miles \u2014 to the Starbucks app and pay that way. That upgrade was made possible by a third-party digital wallet app called Bakkt that converts Bitcoin to dollars to make payments not just possible, but instantaneous. See: What Is Chainlink and Why Is It Important in the World of Cryptocurrency? Online electronics giant Newegg accepts Bitcoin \u2014 and they\u2019ve gone all-in. Unlike some of the others that require you to convert crypto to cash through an app or third-party service, Newegg just lets you pay outright. For shoppers who are buying through a computer, all they have to do is choose \u201cPay With Bitcoin'' and go through the motions of shipping. For shoppers making purchases with their phones, Newegg will send a QR code to scan. For anyone who\u2019s looking to get started harvesting Bitcoins on their own, Newegg also sells cryptocurrency mining starter kits. The Economy and Your Money: All You Need To Know Home Depot, too, is using the Winklevoss/Flexa system \u2014 the same one that allowed Whole Foods to accept Bitcoin through its own digital scanners without investing in new hardware. Retailers have to submit balance sheets in dollars no matter what form of payment they accept, which was long a big stumbling block for companies that wanted to accept Bitcoin but didn\u2019t know how. Flexa converts Bitcoin to dollars instantaneously, which gives both parties what they want. The buyer gets to spend their Bitcoins when they buy their paint and Ryobi tools, and Home Depot gets the green dollars they require in exchange. Read More: Where Does Cryptocurrency Come From? Japanese cashback/shopping site Rakuten began letting users choose Bitcoin as a payment option in 2015. As part of a global Bitcoin rollout, the company started with Rakuten.com in the U.S. before expanding the new service to its counterparts in Germany and Austria. Rakuten made it possible by integrating the Bitnet payment processing platform into its own marketplaces. It has since developed Rakuten Wallet, which has expanded to support altcoins like Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. Users can now charge their Rakuten Cash balance using crypto assets. More Economy Explained: How Does Cryptocurrency Work \u2013 and Is It Safe? Twitch is the 800-pound gorilla on the streaming video platform block. Like Whole Foods, Twitch is owned by Amazon. Also like Whole Foods, it now accepts cryptocurrency \u2014 and not just Bitcoin. Users can pay in Bitcoin, but also Bitcoin Cash and Ether, as well as lesser-used coins like BUSD, PAX, GUSD, USDC, and XRP. Twitch was one of the earliest adopters of crypto, adding it as a payment option in 2014. That, however, ended in 2019 when Twitch quietly removed its Bitcoin service. In June 2020, however, Twitch brought that capability back to the delight of its crypto-conscious users.

The whole of the crypto markets experienced outflows worth $21 million over the week ending June 11. This has contributed to the total outflows of $267 since the middle of May, when cryptocurrencies began their recent difficulties. This amount represents 0.6% of total assets under management (AUM). Ethereum\u2019s native token Ether was hit especially hard last week. Over that period it posted its largest outflow yet, of $12.7 million, according to CoinShares data. Despite this loss, the token has still been one of the strongest performers this year. This is also demonstrated by Ether\u2019s inflows last week, which CoinShares said were mixed, \u201cimplying mixed opinions among investors.\u201d Although Ether is up 4% in the last 24-hours at $2,598. However, that is nearly a 40% drop from its record $4,380 on May 12. Meanwhile, outflows for Bitcoin seemed to have diminished. Despite seeing $10 million in outflows, this pales in comparison to the previous record week of $141 million. Additionally, trading activity in bitcoin products rose 43% from the previous week. Bitcoin seems to be regaining its feet, in light of a recent affirmation from Elon Musk. In replying to an article saying he was pump and dumping Bitcoin, he said Tesla sold only 10% of its Bitcoin holdings to demonstrate its liquidity. Musk then reiterated that Tesla would resume allowing Bitcoin transactions once it was mined with mostly clean energy. Although Bitcoin experienced a bounce at this statement, Musk had earlier included this caveat in his original announcement. Even though that initial tweet sent Bitcoin into a tailspin, throughout this bearish period, several investors have remained bullish. Earlier, Dan Morehead, co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, described this downward period as a buying opportunity. Meanwhile, on Monday, he urged investors to resist closing their positions, despite bitcoin trading 36% below its 11-year exponential trend. \u201cBitcoin generally goes way up, anyone that has held bitcoin for 3.25 years has made money,\u201d Morehead said. Additionally, Bitcoin stalwart Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, continues to pursue his aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Within the past two days MicroStrategy sold an additional $500 million in secured notes to purchase more Bitcoin, then announced selling $1 billion in stock for the same purpose.\u00a0 "}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "Bitcoin and other cryptos lose steam as summer lull sets in ", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-bubble-elon-musk-paul-tudor-jones-fund-managers-084737500.html", "date": "Wed, 16 Jun 2021 08:47:37 GMT", "content": "The bitcoin (BTC-USD) price shot back above $40,000 (\u00a328,346) following sessions of losses, but is treading water as fund managers say the cryptocurrency is in a bubble despite the price crash.\u00a0 According to a Bank of America survey, 81% of fund managers say bitcoin is still a bubble.

Several organisations, including MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Tesla, have invested billions of dollars into cryptocurrencies and traditional financial firms like PayPal (PYPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS) started to handle the asset on behalf of clients.\u00a0 Experts say the crypto craze fuelled interest in bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (ARB.L). \"Argo Blockchain has seen a flurry of interest across social media which is likely to have help propel it into the top of the stocks for June,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Despite the optimism, cryptos face staunch opposition from governments and central banks which have been keen to regulate digital currencies. On Tuesday, the Bank of England (BoE) governor, Andrew Bailey, said digital currencies will not get a regulatory \"free pass\" in the future, despite their potential for innovation. Speaking at TheCityUK's annual conference, Bailey said the bank needs to \"provide a lead in setting out the rules of the road\", noting that playing catchup on digital currencies is not a recipe for success. Bailey doubled down on his earlier position that bitcoin is not money, and has no intrinsic value because it has no backing. He added that stablecoins have the potential to become systemic in terms of their importance in the financial system and its stability, and that UK authorities are already considering the regulatory approach for both systemic and non-systemic stablecoins. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority previously warned that if consumers invest in cryptoassets \"they should be prepared to lose all their money\".

The most recent crisis occurred at Lordstown Motors, which announced Monday the sudden departure of two top executives after warning last week it needed more capital to keep operating. Company officials plan a series of events dubbed \"Lordstown Week\" later this month to shore up investor support. But local government officials are not sure what to make of the company, which had discussed adding more than 2,000 jobs in a region plagued by plant closures. \"Am I confident? Not as much as I was a week ago,\" Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill said earlier this week. \"We're waiting and seeing what the next step is.\" There have been similar leadership shakeups in at least two other electric auto companies that recently went public, raising questions about the transactions and underscoring the difficulties startups face in competing in the capital-intensive industry. \"It's definitely more challenging for a small company,\" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds.com, pointing to heavy spending needed to build and maintain factories and obtain key components. \"It does seem like Tesla is an overnight success story, which is not really the case,\" she told AFP. \"But they came in and disrupted the space amongst automotive companies that have been around for decades. Everyone wants to believe that the dream could happen.\" Lordstown's woes come in the wake of significant electric vehicle (EV) announcements since the November US presidential election from Ford, General Motors and other auto giants, intensifying competition. - Rising costs - Lordstown Motors was launched by Steve Burns in November 2019 after the acquisition of a recently-shuttered Ohio auto plant owned by GM. The company raised $675 million following an October 2020 merger with DiamondPeak Holdings, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) -- essentially a shell company set up to merge with an operating business. Lordstown Motors unveiled its flagship \"Endurance\" all-electric pickup truck in June 2020 when then-vice president Mike Pence visited its Ohio factory, nearly a year before Ford would present its all-electric F-150 pickup. Lordstown's share price topped $30 in February of this year, but the company's fortunes began shifting in March, when short-selling firm Hindenburg Research released a damning report that called Lordstown a \"mirage.\" On Monday, Lordstown announced the resignation of Burns and Chief Financial Officer Julio Rodriguez after an investigation concluded Hindenburg's appraisal was \"in significant respects, false and misleading,\" while acknowledging that some of its own statements about vehicle pre-orders were \"in certain respects, inaccurate.\" That followed Lordstown's June 8 disclosure that it lacks sufficient capital to begin commercial production, and warned about its ability to keep operating. The company's capital spending had swelled in part from \"stress that the Covid-19 pandemic has put on the global automotive supply chain,\" according to a securities filing. Lordstown shares tumbled after Monday's leadership shakeup, but rallied Tuesday after its executives reaffirmed plans during a Detroit event to begin production in September, pointing to \"firm\" orders from clients, according to news reports. In a securities filing Thursday, Lordstown clarified some of those remarks, saying that purchase agreements \"provide us with a significant indicator of demand\" but \"do not represent binding purchase orders.\" - Unfair advantage? - Lordstown is hardly the only EV prospect to stumble after going public through a SPAC. These types of transactions -- which allow companies to enter markets more quickly than with a traditional initial public offering (IPO) -- have soared over the last year. Usha Rodrigues, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, has described SPACs as a \"Vegas wedding IPO\" because a legal loophole gives them protection from lawsuits if their forecasts are not met -- which traditional IPOs do not enjoy. EV startups that benefited from SPACs now appear prone to turbulence. Nikola suffered its own crisis last fall when its founder suddenly resigned following fraud allegations. The CEO and co-founder of Canoo resigned in April, while Lucid Motors in February delayed production of its EV sedan days after announcing a transaction valuing the company at $11.75 billion. Going public through a SPAC may have resulted in some companies getting funds \"before they deserved it,\" Karl Brauer at Carexpert.com said. \"While there's nothing wrong with the SPAC process itself, if it leads to premature funding of a company, it's more likely the company will fail.\" Brauer noted that Tesla needed 15 years to become profitable, adding \"this is a long, dedicated process, one you can't short cut with a quick infusion of cash.\" jmb-jum/cs "}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "Silicon Laboratories Stock Is Believed To Be Modestly Overvalued ", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silicon-laboratories-stock-believed-modestly-030010011.html", "date": "Sat, 19 Jun 2021 02:05:37 GMT", "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters in a telephone interview that the Polestar 3 is \"nicely suited for the U.S. as a ... big, tall, grown-up SUV. This is a win-win situation.\" The Volvo plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina, near Charleston, currently builds the Volvo S60 sedan and will add the Volvo XC90 SUV in 2022, Polestar said on Wednesday. The annual capacity at the plant, which opened in 2018, will be 150,000 vehicles with the Volvo and Polestar SUVs added, a Volvo spokesman said. The Polestar 3 will be built on the same electric premium platform, called the SPA2, as the XC90, Ingenlath said. It will compete with such models as Tesla Inc's Model X SUV. Sweden's Volvo Cars is owned by Geely. The Polestar SUV will initially be sold in the United States, but could eventually be exported, Ingenlath said. Polestar, which was launched in 2017, sells the low-volume halo Polestar 1 hybrid performance car for about $155,000. Its first high-volume car, the Polestar 2, sells for about $60,000. Both cars are built in China. Ingenlath said last year Polestar was targeting annual Polestar 2 sales of more than 50,000 vehicles within two to three years. He said that goal has not changed, but declined to give volume targets for the Polestar 3. The company also is developing a larger, more environmentally friendly sedan called Precept and will build that vehicle at a new plant in China. Ingenlath said taking Polestar public remained a possibility, but the focus is on raising funds to help the company grow. Last year he said Polestar would like eventually to be publicly listed. In April, Polestar raised $550 million from investors to accelerate product development and said further fund raising could occur.

The 2020 update of Lux's \"Automotive Battery Tracker\" report analyzes key metrics related to the impact of electrification on the automotive industry. Leveraging multiple data sources for vehicle sales, combined with Lux's tracking of technical specifications for electrified vehicles, the Automotive Battery Tracker unearths valuable information about trends in battery chemistries and volumes, key OEMs and their suppliers, and which regions are seeing the fastest growth. This report confirms Lux's assertion from the previous update that COVID-19 wasn't a cause for concern for the future of electric vehicles: Combined BEV and PHEV sales increased 37% in 2020 compared to 2019, led by 140% growth in Europe as the BEV market took off in several countries. Tesla remains the most popular BEV maker, but its choice of cells from LG Energy Solution in China means Panasonic lost the market share crown it had held since 2013. Ni-based cathode chemistries, including NCA (23.9%) and NMC (73%), dominate the BEV market today, but future cell-to-pack designs and supply chain concerns will likely see LFP increase market share in the future. \"In our last battery tracker update, we noted that COVID-19 shouldn't cause pessimism for the future outlook of electric vehicles, as automakers had already invested large sums in building BEV platforms, and governments were still pushing for decarbonization,\" explains Christopher Robinson, Research Director at Lux Research and lead author of the report. \"The dramatic close to 2020 proved this point to be true, although admittedly, Lux missed the mark in timing, as the market came back much faster than expected \u2013 and in the process set new quarterly sales and market share records.\" Tesla continues to lead all other manufacturers in plug-in vehicle sales, growing its market share, as it captured 17% of the plug-in vehicles sold globally in 2020 \u2013 a 2% increase from 2019. Tesla's large average pack sizes and strong sales led to the company using 29.8% of all batteries used in 2020. This represents continued momentum in the market \u2013 Tesla alone used 34.5 GWh of batteries in 2020, just three years after all manufacturers combined used 29.7 GWh of batteries in Lux's 2017 battery tracker update. Additionally, Tesla's Model 3 continues to lead all others in sales volume, part of a notable trend: the prevailing success of former startups. Merely two decades ago, Tesla, Nio, and BYD didn't make cars, but they have maintained strong sales despite large investments in electrification platforms from incumbent OEMs. We've reached a pivotal point in battery electric vehicles, as the \"hockey stick\" demand inflection point looks to have occurred in 2020. Automakers will be releasing models built on dedicated platforms built from the ground up for electrification, including, most notably, Hyundai's E-GMP platform, GM's BEV3 platform, and VW's MEB platform.

If 2020 was the year that broke the ESG bank. This year, and next, might see investors start to reap the rewards of Biden\u2019s ultimate \u201cgreen presidency\u201d. In March, Biden unveiled a $2.3-trillion infrastructure plan. On Earth Day, Biden pledged to half U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. According to CNBC, Biden\u2019s climate agenda will likely be a \u201cwindfall for ESG investors\u201d. Gains investors have made so far this year have been stunning enough \u2026 Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) share price is up over $400 in a year. Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) has gone from $1.66 to over $35 in that same time period. Nio (NYSE:NIO) surged from $3.60 to $34. Facedrive (OTCMKTS:FD) shares have more than doubled. Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) gained nearly 600% in 2020 alone. And we\u2019re just getting started. Double the money is set to pour into this sector from the Biden administration. That\u2019s fantastic news for investors who\u2019ve gone green. It looks like Canadian Facedrive (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF), saw the ESG trend before it went mega, and swooped in with a series of acquisitions over the past year designed to leverage the power of tech-driven eco-friendly verticals that could help to reshape the world. They used 2020 to solidify their presence in various initiatives from pioneering EV-focused ride-sharing and food delivery to disruptive EV car subscriptions--across North America. They\u2019re even aiming to be pioneers on the frontlines of the pandemic with proprietary contact tracing technology and wearables that could help get Canadians back to work, safely. With shares surging over 550% in the past year, Facedrive may be getting ready to kick things into overdrive. The Boom Before the Boom: Facedrive Was There First The ESG boom was on even before Biden came to office. Try as it might, the Trump administration could not staunch the inevitable flow of money into ESG. Sustainable investing became the biggest buzzword on Wall Street, and its leader--Black Rock--became the king of the cause. It\u2019s all about money. Lack of sustainability is now a risk that shareholders don\u2019t want to shoulder. Money managers appear to have seen the light of day. BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, plans to have $1.2 trillion in ESG assets within the next 10 years. And it\u2019s estimated that 1/3 of all assets under management in the U.S. are already sustainably invested... That\u2019s potentially $17.1 trillion invested in the companies making giant steps to put people and the planet first. Facedrive (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF) saw the trend before most. It brought electric vehicles to its ridesharing business, in an industry which has been surprisingly bad for rising carbon emissions. With Facedrive, their customers have the choice of hailing a ride from an electric, hybrid, or gas-powered vehicle, all without paying an extra premium for the option. And after they arrive at their final stop, the in-app algorithm calculates the carbon footprint of each journey and a portion of the fare is set aside to plant trees, offsetting part of the carbon footprint from the ride. With the help of next-gen technology and partnerships, they\u2019re making it easier for customers to make more eco-friendly choices. And they\u2019re working with local authorities--not against them--to bolster business. In its biggest move late last year, Facedrive acquired Steer, a subscription-based ride sharing company that offers electric vehicles, from the largest clean energy producer in the United States--giant Exelon. Steer\u2019s ride sharing subscription model, which includes EVs, is aiming to challenge traditional car ownership by making it so easy \u2026 so seamless \u2026 and so affordable for users to have their own virtual showroom of EVs delivered to their door-step, on-demand. It was the perfect fit for Facedrive, which is already aiming to be a fierce competitor to Uber in certain ridesharing markets. Now, it plans to compete with car dealerships at large in both the U.S. and Canada. But with ESG companies seeing a record year in 2020, the markets are already looking forward to what the rest of this year holds. 2021: The Calm Before the ESG Storm ESG funds are still breaking money inflow records, even as markets pause for breath ahead of the big Biden breakout. ESG-focused companies are seeing higher returns, stronger earnings growth and bigger dividends. It\u2019s all about investment performance. That\u2019s why global ESG assets under management (AUM) grew from $6 billion in 2015 to $150 billion in 2020. There looks to be no stopping this march forward. Big money just seems to keep getting bigger. Morgan Stanley has committed to mobilizing $1 trillion by 2030 for sustainable solutions to climate change. And that\u2019s on top of the $1 trillion target some analysts are putting on ESG investments. Armando Senra, head of BlackRock\u2019s iShares America, says ESG funds will have raked in over $21 billion just in Q1 2021--almost the same it pulled in over the entire year in 2019. Senra says ESG could become a $1-trillion category by 2030, noting to CNBC that \u201cwe\u2019re just at the very beginning\u201d of what could be a decade-long growth story. With a new green president at the helm, ESG-focused companies may start reaping some of the benefits for their shareholders, in a big way. We think Facedrive\u2019s business model looks set to benefit from these ESG tailwinds. And it doesn't hurt that they\u2019ve made strategic alliances and investments in content companies for A-list celebrities like Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith\u2026 a company founded by Super Bowl-winning quarterback Russell Wilson\u2026 In just the last year, Facedrive (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF) has struck important partnerships with all of them\u2026 These relationships could help them expand their business into the U.S. and push their eco-friendly mission ahead with apps, apparel, and more. With names like these getting onboard, it\u2019s proving that the ESG boom has gone far beyond just a few people buying electric vehicles. It\u2019s becoming a lifestyle shift that will touch nearly all areas of our economy. Now, they have a relationship with Exelon, too, thanks to their acquisition of Steer, which included a $2-million strategic investment by Exelon\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Exelorate Enterprises, LLC. Facedrive On the Frontlines of the Pandemic Supporting the health of North America\u2019s citizens during these unprecedented times is paramount. Getting them back to work safely is critical to the economy. That\u2019s pushed many ESG-focused companies like Facedrive, to take a more hands on approach to COVID-19. Early last year, Facedrive partnered up with the University of Waterloo and MT>Ventures to create TraceSCAN, a wearable technology used for contact tracing. It offers an innovative approach to tracking that doesn\u2019t rely on cell phones. That could cover massive groups of people previously left without reliable contact tracing solutions to stop the spread... Children, senior citizens, low-income individuals, and employees not able to use phones on the job. And Facedrive has signed agreements with both the government of Ontario and Canada\u2019s largest airline, Air Canada, aiming to implement this technology. So, 2020 was the tipping point of the ESG boom. A \u201cgreen president\u201d has tipped it with a proposed multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure pledge that is ESG all the way. Unsurprisingly, some analysts are now predicting this will \u201cusher in an unprecedented boom for ESG investments\u201d and we think Facedrive could have some big opportunities in 2021 as a result. The ESG Boom Has Arrived Renewable energy providers are some of the top picks for ESG investors, but few have performed as well as Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). Enphase Energy is a leading global supplier of microinverters and solar panels. They have been at the forefront of solar innovation, bringing new technology to market faster than any other company in the industry. The Enphase IQ 7+ system includes an innovative self-learning algorithm that monitors every module on your roof for performance optimization, ensuring you get more from your installation day after day, year after year. Enphase's sleek design makes installing their efficient solar solutions easy for homeowners by simplifying wiring and eliminating the need for bulky junction boxes or expensive mounting racks. Despite the tough first half of the year, however, Enphase has remained a favorite on Wall Street. Year-to-date, Enphase has seen its share price rise by leaps and bounds. And it\u2019s only just getting started. As the renewable push kicks into high gear, and with the United States expected to spend over $1.7 trillion on green energy initiatives over the next decade, Enphase might just emerge as one of the biggest winners. NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is another shining star in the renewable world. They have a wide range of products and services for both residential and commercial customers. One of their key offerings is solar power which has been growing at an exponential rate over the past few years due to global climate change initiatives. NextEra Energy works with many different companies like Apple, Amazon, Nestle Waters North America among others to help them become more sustainable by investing in renewable energy sources as well as helping them reduce their carbon footprint through providing quality products and services that lower utility bills. NextEra is the world\u2019s leading producer of wind and solar energy, so it\u2019s no surprise that it has received some love from the \u2018millennial dollar.\u2019 In fact, in 2018, the company was the number one capital investor in green energy infrastructure, and fifth largest capital investor across all sectors. No other company has been more active in reducing carbon emissions. And they\u2019re just getting started. By 2025, the company aims to reduce their own emissions by 67 percent while doubling their electricity production from a 2005 benchmark. To put this into perspective, if all of America\u2019s utilities were able to achieve NextEra Energy\u2019s projected 2025 emissions rate, absolute CO2 emissions for the power sector would be approximately 75% lower than they were in 2005. Not even the supermajors in the oil industry can ignore the ESG demand from investors. They\u2019ve been diversifying their portfolios to hedge their bets in the rapidly changing new reality of energy. And no other oil major takes this more seriously than Total (NYSE:TOT). Total has led the charge to go green. It is not only aware of the needs that are not being met by a significant portion of the world\u2019s growing population, it is also hyper-aware of the looming climate crisis if changes are not made. As such, Total is not only betting big on renewable energy, it is also doing its part in reducing emissions in its day-to-day activities. Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Total noted, \u201cIt\u2019s our job to meet growing energy needs while reducing carbon emissions.\u201d It's also one of the most conscious companies in the business. Total checks every box in the ESG checklist. It is promoting diversity and safety, making massive changes in its operations to ensure that its business is environmentally sound, and has even committed to going carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner. It\u2019s no surprise that shareholders are loving its forward-thinking approach. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) needs no introduction. It is the world\u2019s largest global investment management corporation, with over $7.4 trillion in assets under management. With clients in over 100 different countries, it is the de facto leader in its field. And just a few years ago, BlackRock underwent a major shift in its investment strategy, prioritizing stocks with high ESG ratings. BlackRock\u2019s focus on technology and sustainability has fueled the new trend in the marketplace, pushing even more investors to consciously consider where they put their money. There\u2019s a reason BlackRock is blowing Wall Street out of the water right now--sustainable investing. The new king of Wall Street recognized the trend well before the competition and bought into the sustainable investing ethos long ago and is now looking to take its sustainable portfolio from $90 billion to more than a trillion dollars. In June of last year, BlackRock even launched a new suite of funds focused on the ESG trend. The funds include; iShares ESG Aware Conservative Allocation ETF (EAOK); the iShares ESG Aware Moderate Allocation ETF (EAOM); the iShares ESG Aware Growth Allocation ETF (EAOR); and the iShares ESG Aware Aggressive Allocation ETF (EAOA). Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is another way to capitalize on the EV hype. Despite being a bit late to jump on the sustainability train, Uber is finally making some changes in its operations. In late 2019, a scathing report about how much the ride-sharing giant was contributing to emissions emerged, suggesting that Uber and Lyft added as much as 70% more to global emissions than traditional alternatives prompting backlash among environmentalists. In fact, Uber even rolled out a new program to help drivers transition to electric vehicles. The $800 million \u2018Green Future\u2019 initiative, with the help of Chevrolet, allows drivers to get a near-$3000 discount on Bolt EV Premiers. Additionally, drivers of low-emission vehicles will also get a small bonus for every ride they complete. They will also get a discount on specific charging platforms to help cut costs during the transition. \u201cAs the largest mobility platform in the world, we know that our impact goes beyond our technology. We want to do our part to build back better and support a green recovery in our cities and communities,\u201d CEO Dara Khosrowshahi noted on the company\u2019s website. Canada\u2019s Silicon Valley is joining the ESG race, too. Shopify Inc (NASDAQ:SHOP; TSX:SH) is an absolute beast in the e-commerce world. In fact, because of its simple-to-use platform, it would be hard to have not stumbled onto a shop built with its technology. More than 1,000,000 businesses rely on Shopify\u2019s real-time e-commerce solutions, including Tesla, Budweiser and Red Bull, among many others. Shopify makes purchasing goods and services easy for anyone \u2013 and in a time where convenience is king, Shopify surely has staying power. In addition to its revolutionary approach on e-commerce, Shopify is also delving into blockchain technology, making it a promising pick for investors, especially given that the sector is red hot right now. Its clients are even able to accept bitcoin and a variety of other cryptocurrencies as payments with a few clicks. Global lockdowns accelerated Shopify\u2019s already-tremendous growth. Since March 2020 alone, Shopify has seen its price rise from just $495 per share to a high of $1800 per share before settling down to its current price. The company has already shown its potential, but as it continues to grow, so will its innovative solutions for businesses, and by extension, its share price. Shopify is one of the few e-commerce companies that may very well be able to compete with the likes of Amazon. Magna International (NYSE:MGA, TSX:MG) is an interesting roundabout way get in on the exciting resource and battery markets without betting big on one of the new unproven stocks captivating millennials right now. The six-decade-year-old manufacturing giant provides mobility technology for automakers of all types. From GM and Ford to luxury brands like BMW and Tesla, Magna is a master at striking deals. And it\u2019s clear to see why. The company has the experience and reputation that automakers are looking for. Over 10 years ago, Magna was already making major moves in the battery market, investing over half a billion dollars in battery production while the market was still in its infancy. At the time, electric vehicles as we know them had barely hit the scene, with Tesla launching its premiere car just two years prior. Magna\u2019s massive investment has paid if in a big way, however. Since its battery bet, the company has seen its valuation soar by tens of billions of dollars, and it has solidified itself as one of the leaders in the business. With the semiconductor industry in chaos, and another looming lithium and helium shortage, it will be interesting to see how Magna deals with these challenges. Maple Leaf Foods (TSX:MFI) is another veteran in the Canadian foods realm. Since 1991, Maple Leaf has been making aggressive acquisitions, supplying high-quality foods, and leading in new innovations to ensure the highest quality products for all of its consumers around Canada. And just last year, it announced its plans to dive head first into the plant-based foods industry with a $310 million facility in Shelbyville, Indiana. More than that, however, Maple Leaf Foods is also committed to slashing its own carbon footprint. In fact, on November 7, 2019, the company announced that it was the first major carbon-neutral food company \u2013 a huge claim to fame in a world racing to go green. The Very Good Food Company Inc. (CSE:VERY) is a Canadian company that is quickly gaining a lot of ground in the market. With the slogan, \u201cwe believe in butchering beans, not animals,\u201d they\u2019re looking to tap into the plant-based niche in a hurry. And it\u2019s resonated very well with investors. Since its IPO in June, the Very Good Food Company has seen its share price grow by over 70%, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. In just a few short months, the company has opened several new facilities, signed a string of deals, and is quickly carving out its place in Canada\u2019s fast-growing plant-based lifestyle scene. GreenPower Motor (TSX:GPV) is a promising young electric bus manufacturer. Currently, its focus is primarily on the North American market, but it has plenty of room to grow as the industry takes off. Founded over a decade ago, GreenPower has been on the frontlines of the electric movement, manufacturing affordable battery-electric busses and trucks. From school busses to long-distance public transit, GreenPower\u2019s impact on the sector can\u2019t be ignored. Year-to-date, GreenPower Motor has seen its share price soar from $2.03 to $24.45. That means investors have seen 1104% gains this year alone. And with this red-hot sector only going up, GreenPower will likely continue to impress. By. Louise Matthias **IMPORTANT!

Commentators, particularly media figures, have engaged in some justifiable hand-wringing about the implications of a venture capital firm starting an \u201cowned media\u201d operation. That anxiety has been heightened by a broader context of Trumpist skepticism towards the media, and a wave of tech-specific media backlash spearheaded by companies like Tesla and influential figures like Balaji Srinivasan. After looking at the first wave of items published on Future.com today, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much reason to panic about the site. In fact, there\u2019s much to admire, including an abundance of smart and informative pieces on cryptocurrency systems. I hope other entities planning to open in-house media, including Coinbase, are taking notes \u2013 because while Future.com looks great, the risks of such an operation are still real. David Z. Morris is CoinDesk\u2019s chief insights columnist. Related: On the Road: A Lesson About Open Access and Bitcoin Above all, it\u2019s good that Future.com is explicitly an opinion and educational publication, not a news site. In broad terms, that\u2019s important because there would be an inherent, deep conflict of interest to a16z reporting news about specific companies that it was invested in, or companies that competed with its investments. It would have strong motivations to distort or omit facts in ways that benefited it. I trust a16z enough that I\u2019d expect it to run a clean operation, but even the perception of such conflicts would have made its content much less valuable. Instead of news about the present, Future.com is focused on theories about, well \u2026. the future. Its first round of articles includes incredibly deep thought pieces about hybrid work and the future of intellectual property on DAOs, for instance. These pieces cite information about specific companies, and some are authored by the staffers from Andreessen portfolio firms. But they\u2019re primarily about problems or opportunities shared by many different companies. The depth and subtlety of these pieces is another notable point in Future.com\u2019s favor. This piece on the lessons of containerization in shipping from Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen, for instance, clocks in at nearly 2,200 words (about nine printed pages), and includes wonky details about things like changing China-U.S. transit times and container ship size. Speaking as someone with nearly a decade of experience in the news business, it\u2019s very rare for content of this depth to find a home at for-profit media sites. For one, the business model often can\u2019t support paying writers for the amount of work involved. Even commentary from people like CEOs, while often provided gratis to publications, is usually streamlined to cater to readers interested in speed, not depth. Related: Kim Kardashian and Ethereum Max. Why? From that perspective, Future.com models perhaps the best reason for tech companies to bypass the mainstream media \u2013 not to present their perspective to the general public, but to provide a level of mind-numbing, un-economical depth in which only insiders are likely to be interested. The thing I would compare Future.com to most, in fact, isn\u2019t a news site like CoinDesk or Bloomberg, but an academic research journal. The site isn\u2019t peer-reviewed, but it shares much of the same insularity as journals. Margit Wennmachers, one of the heads of the project, told TechCrunch that it\u2019s aimed at \u201ctech people\u201d and \u201cthe tech curious.\u201d The contributors include tech CEOs, professional investors, and more than a few actual academics. The site\u2019s presentation is almost aggressively low-key: As of now, for instance, there are no images on the site\u2019s frontpage. That would be absolutely suicidal for a standalone news site trying to catch the eye of a casual observer. This emphasis on dry, academic depth should be additive to existing news sites, rather than competitive. It also significantly reduces the possibility that its contents will be manipulative, for the simple reason that easily-manipulated people tend to have really short attention spans and little appetite for learning. More abstractly, it\u2019s also arguably a benefit to readers that they know not to expect objectivity from Future.com. A16z is an investment firm, and seems set on using the new site primarily to flesh out the thinking behind its own investments. In investment circles that\u2019s known as \u201ctalking your own book,\u201d and it\u2019s pretty common and unproblematic behavior \u2013 as long as it\u2019s transparent that that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. Future.com could definitely improve on its transparency by adding explicit disclosures of its investments to related stories. Currently its disclosures take the form of a boilerplate small-text block at the end of each story, without specific investments cited. But the kinds of readers willing to slog through 2,000 words on the future of robot lawyers would also take a moment to click over to the a16z disclosures page to figure out that it was written by the CEO of a portfolio company. All that being said, there\u2019s a larger context here that is still worrying. Tech companies publishing what are effectively their business theses seems fair enough, but it does risk reducing the traditional press\u2019s ability to ask hard questions of the businesses themselves. This has already happened with Tesla, a company that can communicate directly with its rabid fanbase so effectively that it actually disbanded its public relations department in 2020. There\u2019s literally nobody there anymore to answer questions from the press, a situation that ultimately increases the risk for Tesla stockholders. Maybe Future.com will become influential enough that a16z companies also decide to go direct. And a16z, with its track record of backing operations like Facebook, Instagram, and Clubhouse, certainly knows how to reach and engage a truly mass audience. But for now, that seems if anything to be the opposite of the thinking behind Future.com. Tesla was able to connect with a wide swathe of retail investors largely thanks to its flashy, charismatic and impulsive CEO. Andreessen Horowitz seems to know it can\u2019t pull off the same trick. Instead, its operation is leaning hard into being, frankly, boring as hell for anyone who isn\u2019t already extraordinarily well-informed. And that should be just fine by media professionals.

The world's second biggest carmaker is trying to exert more control over key components in its supply chain such as semiconductors and lithium so it can overcome any potential bottlenecks and keep its plants running at full capacity. The German carmaker is also trying to catch up with rivals such as Tesla and BMW which have already struck supply deals with producers of lithium, one of the main components in EV batteries. \"We're all in a race. It's about making the most affordable cells and you need scale to do that,\" said Thomas Schmall, Volkswagen's board member in charge of technology. \"Apart from cell manufacturing, which is a new area of business for us, we need to move into vertical integration more strongly, procuring and securing raw materials. This can happen via various forms of cooperation,\" he said. Gaining direct control over the supply of raw materials for EV batteries - which also include graphite, cobalt and nickel - is also vital to get a better handle on costs, Schmall said. \"80% of cell costs are determined by raw materials. So it's obvious that one needs to be more engaged.\" While Schmall did not identify potential suppliers, he said Volkswagen's goal was to have a small number of larger players to keep complexity under control. The lithium market is controlled by mining companies such as U.S. firm Albemarle, China's Tianqi Lithium and Chile's Sociedad Quimica y Minera. Among others, Volkswagen is seeking closer ties with Germany's BASF, one of the world's largest suppliers of battery materials, according to two people familiar with the matter. Both companies entered a partnership last week along with Daimler and Fairphone to explore ways to produce lithium responsibly in Chile's Atacama salt flat, home to a quarter of the world's current lithium supply. Volkswagen aims to overtake Tesla as the global EV leader by the middle of the decade and has mapped out plans to build six battery factories across Europe by 2030 together with partners. Schmall said Volkswagen was very close to picking a partner for its planned battery factory in Salzgitter and hoped to give more details in the coming months, adding that all six factories would include strategic partnerships. BMW has already struck deals with U.S. lithium manufacturer Livent and China's Ganfeng Lithium, one of the world's top producers. Tesla, meanwhile, has agreed a five-year lithium hydroxide supply deal with China's Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group. Volkswagen is also trying to get closer to chipmakers in the face of a global shortage of semiconductors, highlighting the multiple fronts it must tackle with its 150 billion euro ($182 billion) spending plan. \"For carmakers, it is strategically important to strengthen control over supply chains,\" said Ralf Blessmann, the head of Capgemini's automotive division in Germany. \"The current chip crisis has laid bare the risks with regard to supply shortages.\" ($1 = 0.8249 euros) (Reporting by Christoph Steitz and Jan Schwartz; Editing by Jane Merriman and David Clarke) "}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "title": "Ukrainian police arrest multiple Clop ransomware gang suspects ", "url": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/ukrainian-police-arrest-multiple-clop-163346539.html", "date": "Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:33:46 GMT", "content": "Multiple suspects believed to be linked to the Clop ransomware gang have been detained in Ukraine after a joint operation from law enforcement agencies in Ukraine, South Korea and the United States. The Cyber Police Department of the National Police of Ukraine confirmed that six arrests were made after searches at 21 residences in the capital Kyiv and nearby regions. While it's unclear whether the defendants are affiliates or core developers of the ransomware operation, they are accused of running a \"double extortion\" scheme, in which victims who refuse to pay the ransom are threatened with the leak of data stolen from their networks prior to their files being encrypted. \"It was established that six defendants carried out attacks of malicious software such as 'ransomware' on the servers of American and [South] Korean companies,\" alleged Ukraine's national police force in a statement. The police also seized equipment from the alleged Clop ransomware gang, said to behind total financial damages of about $500 million. This includes computer equipment, several cars \u2014 including a Tesla and Mercedes, and 5 million Ukrainian Hryvnia (around $185,000) in cash. The authorities also claim to have successfully shut down the server infrastructure used by the gang members to launch previous attacks. \"Together, law enforcement has managed to shut down the infrastructure from which the virus spreads and block channels for legalizing criminally acquired cryptocurrencies,\" the statement added. These attacks first began in February 2019, when the group attacked four Korean companies and encrypted 810 internal services and personal computers. Since, Clop \u2014 often styled as \"Cl0p\" \u2014 has been linked to a number of high-profile ransomware attacks. These include the breach of U.S. pharmaceutical giant ExecuPharm in April 2020 and the attack on South Korean e-commerce giant E-Land in November that forced the retailer to close almost half of its stores. Hackers publish ExecuPharm internal data after ransomware attack Clop is also linked to the ransomware attack and data breach at Accellion, which saw hackers exploit flaws in the IT provider\u2019s File Transfer Appliance (FTA) software to steal data from dozens of its customers. Victims of this breach include Singaporean telecom Singtel, law firm Jones Day, grocery store chain Kroger and cybersecurity firm Qualys. At the time of writing, the dark web portal that Clop uses to share stolen data is still up and running, although it hasn't been updated for several weeks. However, law enforcement typically replaces the targets' website with their own logo in the event of a successful takedown, which suggests that members of the gang could still be active. \u201cThe Cl0p operation has been used to disrupt and extort organizations globally in a variety of sectors including telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, aerospace, and technology,\" said John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at Mandiant's threat intelligence unit. \"The actor FIN11 has been strongly associated with this operation, which has included both ransomware and extortion, but it is unclear if the arrests included FIN11 actors or others who may also be associated with the operation.\u201d Hultquist said the efforts of the Ukrainian police \u201care a reminder that the country is a strong partner for the U.S. in the fight against cybercrime and authorities there are making the effort to deny criminals a safe harbor.\u201d The alleged perpetrators face up to eight years in prison on charges of unauthorized interference in the work of computers, automated systems, computer networks, or telecommunications networks and laundering property obtained by criminal means. News of the arrests comes as international law enforcement turns up the heat on ransomware gangs.

The committee rebuffed the bid by Republican Senator John Thune to attach measures lifting regulations on autonomous vehicles to a $78 billion surface transportation bill after he sought last month to attach it in May to a bill on China tech policy. Thune has proposed granting the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the power to grant exemptions for tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles per manufacturer from safety standards written with human drivers in mind. The surface bill, which would boost funding for Amtrak and other transportation needs, was approved by the committee on a 25-3 vote. Thune and other lawmakers have sought for nearly five years to win approval. The senator argued autonomous vehicles could help eliminate numerous deaths due to human error like distracted or impaired drivers. Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, cited recent Tesla crashes and other recent incidents involving driver assistance systems in her response. \"It seems like every other week we're hearing about a new vehicle that crashed when it was on Autopilot\" Cantwell said. \"I do think this is legislation that we can complete by the end of this year... These last issues are very thorny as it relates to legal structure.\" \"Democrats have yielded to pressure from special interests against the best interests of our economy and the American people,\" Thune said. \"Are we really going to continue to ignore the enormous safety benefits of these vehicles?\" Thune said that the \"Teamsters and trial lawyers\" are opposed to self-driving legislation and they \"seem to own lock, stock and barrel the Democrats on this committee.\" The Teamsters did not immediately comment. The American Association for Justice, which represents plaintiffs lawyers said it \"will continue to oppose any legislation that exempts the driverless car industry from basic safety standards, and allows auto and tech companies to avoid being held accountable through the use of forced arbitration clauses.\" The Self-Driving Coalition, which represents Ford Motor Co, Alphabet Inc's Waymo, Volvo Cars and others said \"the exclusion of AV legislation from current surface transportation reauthorization bills reflects yet another missed opportunity to save lives\" but it vowed to work with lawmakers. Last month, Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department for the AFL-CIO, told U.S. lawmakers that autonomous vehicles place \"millions of jobs at risk\" and any self-driving legislation should not apply to commercial trucks.

The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency had a promising start to the week following an intervention by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who said that the electric vehicle company would resume accepting Bitcoin once there is confirmation of reasonable clean energy usage by miners. Bitcoin received further upside impetus after billionaire fund manager Paul Tudor Jones said he likes Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier. After the great start to the week, Bitcoin has traded in a relatively narrow range over the last two trading days and appears to be magnetised to the $40,000 level. On Tuesday, the price briefly traded above $41,000 but some key technical resistance is in play if Bitcoin pushes higher. The next key level to look out for would be the 200 Day Moving Average (DMA) which sits around $42,700 and a break above that would bring the 50DMA into play at around $44,000. However, what will concern some traders is that those two levels are continuing to converge and the formation of a \u2018Death Cross\u2019 \u2013 when the 50DMA moves below the 200DMA \u2013 is on the horizon. Historically, a \u2018Death Cross\u2019 represents a sell signal amid a breakdown of momentum to the upside. The next potential catalyst for a move could be today\u2019s Federal Reserve interest rate decision. \u201cHeading into the FOMC, Bitcoin could see limited downward pressure if a less dovish Fed sends the dollar bouncing back.,\u201d OANDA Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said in an emailed note. \u201cPost any Fed driven weakness, Bitcoin should find the $42,500 as the next key resistance level.\u201d At 11:53BST, the price of Bitcoin was trading around $39,760.

Although the country\u2019s total vehicle sales for May 2021 fell 3% year over year, snapping the 13-month winning streak, electric vehicles remained a bright spot for the world\u2019s largest auto market. Per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, NEVs including all-electric, hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles surged a whopping 160% year over year to 217,000 units in May, marking the 11th straight month of increase. Key electric vehicle (EV) firms based in China witnessed a massive surge in sales volumes last month. NIO Inc. NIO \u2014 dubbed as the Tesla TSLA of China \u2014 delivered 6,711 vehicles, marking a year-over-year rise of 95.3%. Li Auto LI and XPeng Inc. XPEV delivered 4,323 and 5,686 units, representing year-over-year growth of 101.3% and 483%, respectively. Warren-Buffett-backed BYD Co. Ltd. BYDDY sold 32,800 all-electric and hybrids vehicles, up 190% year over year. Pure electric passenger cars delivered by the firm jumped 126% year over year to 18,711 units. U.S.-based EV king Tesla sold 33,463 EVs made in China in May 2021, up from 25,845 sold in April, per the China Passenger Car Association (\u201cCPCA\u201d). China's NEV industry has been on the uptrend since July 2020, backed by government stimulus measures like extended subsidies and tax exemptions, which have boosted the sale of green vehicles.\u00a0Advancement in the EV charging infrastructure in the nation owing to state-of-the-art technologies is further driving the demand for eco-friendly vehicles. Buoyed by favorable government policies along with improving consumer confidence and economy, the rebound in green vehicle demand and sales is expected to continue. China-based EV makers including NIO, XPeng and BYD are actively expanding their production capacity in the country, thanks to the government's promotion of zero-emission vehicles. Banking on the EV euphoria in China, various auto biggies including Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors GM and Ford F are ramping up investments in the China EV market.\u00a0 China\u2019s big push toward green vehicle adoption and EV supply chain dominance bodes well.\u00a0Importantly, the country projects EVs to account for 25% of new car sales by 2025.\u00a0CPCA projects NEV sales in China to hit 2.4 million units this year, indicating an increase from around 1.3 million units in 2020. Per a report by Deloitte, by 2030, China will account for 49% of the global EV market. During the China Auto Chongqung Summit held over the last weekend, Wang Chuanfu, the founder of BYD, predicted that sales of NEVs will account for 70% of China\u2019s new vehicle sales by 2030. NIO\u2019s founder, William Li, seems more optimistic, forecasting a penetration rate of 90%, per media reports. Given the upbeat scenario, we highlight four stocks that would help you capitalize on the China EV market\u2019s solid prospects. General Motors: U.S. auto giant General Motors commands a huge presence in China, which is the biggest EV market in the world. The company strengthened its line-up in China with Hong Guang Mini EV, which was launched last July under the Wuling brand. It is currently the best-selling EV in China. General Motors is accelerating the development of advanced technologies in China to enable an all-electric future. The company\u2019s next-generation EVs (across all brands) in China will be powered by Ultium Drive, General Motors\u2019 proprietary battery platform.

China is the second biggest market for this EV behemoth, where the company is spending heavily to boost earnings prospects. Tesla\u2019s Shanghai factory is ramping up well and commands a higher market share in the China EV market.\u00a0Robust production of Model 3 and Y \u2014 which are among the top 5 hot-selling EVs in the country \u2014 at the Shanghai Gigafactory bodes well. The plant is operating at full capacity and Tesla plans to further expand it, which provides the company with enough growth visibility.

Ford: Ford is going the extra mile to demonstrate its EV prowess in China, which happens to be its second-largest market.\u00a0The firm\u2019s China 2.0 business transformation plan is aimed at strengthening product line-up, with more customer-centric products and focus on customer experiences.

(NYSE:BIOX) and determine whether it is a good investment right now. We at Insider Monkey like to examine what billionaires and hedge funds think of a company before spending days of research on it. Given their 2 and 20 payment structure, hedge funds have more incentives and resources than the average investor. The funds have access to expert networks and get tips from industry insiders. They also employ numerous Ivy League graduates and MBAs. Like everyone else, hedge funds perform miserably at times, but their consensus picks have historically outperformed the market after risk adjustments. Is BIOX stock a buy? Prominent investors were buying. The number of long hedge fund positions advanced by 3 recently. Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NYSE:BIOX) was in 4 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 7. Our calculations also showed that BIOX isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Hedge funds have more than $3.5 trillion in assets under management, so you can't expect their entire portfolios to beat the market by large margins. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here).

Such cars are normally major gas guzzlers. But not Swedish Koeniggseg. The company, which makes about 30 cars annually that sell for a couple of million each, recently hired a former Tesla executive to help it transform into a mass car manufacturer\u2014a mass car manufacturer of vehicles that use the emissions of volcanoes as a way to moderate their carbon footprint. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Koeniggseg's new chief industrialization officer Evan Horetsky explained the volcano emission idea simply.\u00a0 \"So there is this technology from Iceland, it was invented there, where they cap the CO2 emittance from semi-active volcanoes and convert that into methanol,\" Horetsky said. \"And if you take that methanol and you power the plants that do the conversion of other fuels and then power the ship that transports those fuels to Europe or the U.S. or Asia, wherever it goes, you put the fuel completely CO2-neutral into the vehicle.\" The developer of this technology is an Icelandic firm, Carbon Recycling. In 2013, the MIT Technology Review wrote about the company's technology that turned carbon dioxide emissions from a geothermal plant into methanol\u2014a raw material for a number of productions, including plywood and paints, but also a fuel. In the article, the author Kevin Bulis noted that Carbon Recycling had the advantage of having access to cheaper CO2 than the one that, for instance, coal power plants emit. The difference in cost comes from the process that leads to the emission. In the geothermal plant, the CO2 is the product of the decomposition of carbonate rocks near a volcano. In a coal power plant, carbon dioxide is one of the components of so-called flue gas \u2013 the product of burning coal. Therefore, at a geothermal plant, the stream of CO2 is a lot more concentrated and a lot purer. This makes its use easier and therefore cheaper. In a coal power plant, you need to first separate the CO2 from the other constituents of flue gas and then process it into methanol, which makes the process a lot more expensive. Related: Investors Are Buying Bitcoin In A Bear Market But Ignoring Oil In A Bull Market Expensive or not, according to a Verge article from last year, Koeniggseg's Gemera hybrid runs on \"renewable alcohol fuel.\" The publication called the Gemera \"the world's most wickedly weird hybrid,\" noting its three electric motors and a three-cylinder, internal combustion engine that runs on methanol. Koeniggseg itself calls the Gemera's internal combustion engine the Tiny Friendly Giant, and boasts that it has a 15-20 percent lower fuel consumption than a typical four-cylinder engine, lower cold-start emissions, and, perhaps most impressive of all, says that this engine actually cleans the air. \"When running the TFG on renewable alcohol fuels \u2013 there are virtually no particulates produced and in many \"normal\" environments the TFG consumes and burns more particles from the surrounding air than it produces, thereby actually cleaning the air,\" the company says in the description of its TFG engine. \"Using the best alternatives of alcohols there is even the chance for net-zero or CO2 negative emissions.\" It sounds somewhat paradoxical, and the company admits it. Yet the engine that runs on alcohol is very much a real thing and, per Keniggseg's plans, will become a much more common thing as the company ramps up its vehicle production. Whether the methanol these future Koeniggsegs will use will come from volcano-related CO2 emissions, however, remains to be seen. You need a handy nearby volcano for this. Yet, there are other ways to get negative emissions from a car, according to Horetsky. \"Depending on the environment you're in, you can kind of clean up the particles in the atmosphere while you're using the engine,\" he told Bloomberg. \"So you can be very much environmentally conscious doing that. It's just a fun aspect of renewable fuels that are not talked so much about, but there are many, many other technologies that are coming up.\" By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com: Not All Electric Vehicle Companies Are Created Equal Oil Markets Baffled As The IEA Calls For More Production Goldman Sachs Doubles Down On $80 Oil Prediction Read this article on OilPrice.com "}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "Adobe: Continuing Growth at a Reasonable Price ", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adobe-continuing-growth-reasonable-price-210207071.html", "date": "Fri, 18 Jun 2021 21:02:07 GMT", "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

With billions of dollars in assets, smart money investors have to conduct complex analyses, spend many resources and use tools that are not always available for the general crowd. This doesn't mean that they don't have occasional colossal losses; they do (like Melvin Capital's recent GameStop losses). However, it is still a good idea to keep an eye on hedge fund activity. With this in mind, as the current round of 13F filings has just ended, let\u2019s examine the smart money sentiment towards U.S. Lime & Minerals Inc. (NASDAQ:USLM). Is USLM a good stock to buy? U.S. Lime & Minerals Inc. (NASDAQ:USLM) investors should pay attention to a decrease in hedge fund interest in recent months. U.S. Lime & Minerals Inc. (NASDAQ:USLM) was in 4 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 7. There were 5 hedge funds in our database with USLM holdings at the end of December. Our calculations also showed that USLM isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). At the moment there are a multitude of gauges market participants have at their disposal to analyze stocks. Some of the best gauges are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. Our experts have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the elite hedge fund managers can trounce the S&P 500 by a healthy amount (see the details here). Also, our monthly newsletter's portfolio of long stock picks returned 206.8% since March 2017 (through May 2021) and beat the S&P 500 Index by more than 115 percentage points. You can download a sample issue of this newsletter on our website . Chuck Royce of Royce & Associates At Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, an activist hedge fund wants to buy this $27 biotech stock for $50. So, we recommended a long position to our monthly premium newsletter subscribers. We go through lists like the 10 best battery stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. With all of this in mind we're going to review the key hedge fund action regarding U.S. Lime & Minerals Inc. (NASDAQ:USLM). At Q1's end, a total of 4 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -20% from one quarter earlier. Below, you can check out the change in hedge fund sentiment towards USLM over the last 23 quarters. So, let's review which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves. According to publicly available hedge fund and institutional investor holdings data compiled by Insider Monkey, Renaissance Technologies, holds the most valuable position in U.S. Lime & Minerals Inc. (NASDAQ:USLM). Renaissance Technologies has a $27.8 million position in the stock, comprising less than 0.1%% of its 13F portfolio. Coming in second is Royce & Associates, led by Chuck Royce, holding a $14.2 million position; 0.1% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the company. Some other members of the smart money that hold long positions encompass David P. Cohen's Minerva Advisors, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group and . In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Minerva Advisors allocated the biggest weight to U.S. Lime & Minerals Inc. (NASDAQ:USLM), around 2.86% of its 13F portfolio. Royce & Associates is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 0.1 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to USLM. Due to the fact that U.S. Lime & Minerals Inc. (NASDAQ:USLM) has witnessed bearish sentiment from the entirety of the hedge funds we track, it's easy to see that there was a specific group of fund managers that decided to sell off their entire stakes last quarter. At the top of the heap, Roger Ibbotson's Zebra Capital Management dumped the largest position of all the hedgies tracked by Insider Monkey, totaling an estimated $0.3 million in stock. Jeffrey Bronchick's fund, Cove Street Capital, also said goodbye to its stock, about $0 million worth. These transactions are intriguing to say the least, as aggregate hedge fund interest fell by 1 funds last quarter. Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to U.S. Lime & Minerals Inc. (NASDAQ:USLM). These stocks are Asensus Surgical, Inc. (NYSE:ASXC), Loma Negra Compania Industrial Argentina Sociedad Anonima (NYSE:LOMA), Central Pacific Financial Corp. (NYSE:CPF), Aspira Women's Health Inc. (NASDAQ:AWH), AdvanSix Inc. (NYSE:ASIX), Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SPWH), and SLR Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:SLRC). This group of stocks' market caps resemble USLM's market cap.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 11.4 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $65 million. That figure was $48 million in USLM's case. AdvanSix Inc. (NYSE:ASIX) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Loma Negra Compania Industrial Argentina Sociedad Anonima (NYSE:LOMA) is the least popular one with only 6 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks U.S. Lime & Minerals Inc. (NASDAQ:USLM) is even less popular than LOMA. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for USLM is 21.1. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Hedge funds dodged a bullet by taking a bearish stance towards USLM. Our calculations showed that the top 10 most popular hedge fund stocks returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th but managed to beat the market again by 3.3 percentage points. Unfortunately USLM wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was very bearish); USLM investors were disappointed as the stock returned 6.2% since the end of the first quarter (through 6/11) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market since 2019.

(NASDAQ:WRAP) is a good investment right now. We like to check what the smart money thinks first before doing extensive research on a given stock. Although there have been several high profile failed hedge fund picks, the consensus picks among hedge fund investors have historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk attributes. It's not surprising given that hedge funds have access to better information and more resources to predict the winners in the stock market. Hedge fund interest in Wrap Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:WRAP) shares was flat at the end of last quarter. This is usually a negative indicator. Our calculations also showed that WRAP isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). At the end of this article we will also compare WRAP to other stocks including International Tower Hill Mines Ltd (NYSE:THM), Savara, Inc. (NASDAQ:SVRA), and Equillium, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQ) to get a better sense of its popularity. So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We have been able to outperform the passive index funds by tracking the moves of corporate insiders and hedge funds, and we believe small investors can benefit a lot from reading hedge fund investor letters and 13F filings. Donald Sussman of Paloma Partners At Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, an activist hedge fund wants to buy this $28 biotech stock for $50. So, we recommended a long position to our monthly premium newsletter subscribers.

With all of this in mind we're going to check out the recent hedge fund action encompassing Wrap Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:WRAP). At the end of March, a total of 4 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of 0% from one quarter earlier. On the other hand, there were a total of 2 hedge funds with a bullish position in WRAP a year ago. With hedge funds' positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a few noteworthy hedge fund managers who were boosting their stakes substantially (or already accumulated large positions). Of the funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Kamunting Street Capital, managed by Allan Teh, holds the biggest position in Wrap Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:WRAP). Kamunting Street Capital has a $1.7 million position in the stock, comprising 0.7% of its 13F portfolio. Coming in second is Ken Griffin of Citadel Investment Group, with a $0.9 million call position; less than 0.1%% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the company. Remaining members of the smart money that hold long positions contain Daniel S. Och's OZ Management, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group and Allan Teh's Kamunting Street Capital. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position 0 allocated the biggest weight to Wrap Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:WRAP), around 0.66% of its 13F portfolio. 0 is also relatively very bullish on the stock, setting aside 0.11 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to WRAP. Since Wrap Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:WRAP) has faced declining sentiment from the aggregate hedge fund industry, we can see that there lies a certain \"tier\" of hedgies that elected to cut their positions entirely last quarter. Intriguingly, Israel Englander's Millennium Management cut the largest investment of the \"upper crust\" of funds monitored by Insider Monkey, totaling about $0.5 million in stock, and Donald Sussman's Paloma Partners was right behind this move, as the fund sold off about $0.1 million worth. These moves are interesting, as total hedge fund interest stayed the same (this is a bearish signal in our experience). Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Wrap Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:WRAP). We will take a look at International Tower Hill Mines Ltd (NYSE:THM), Savara, Inc. (NASDAQ:SVRA), Equillium, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQ), Identiv, Inc. (NASDAQ:INVE), Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc (NASDAQ:SAMG), Medicenna Therapeutics Corp. (NASDAQ:MDNA), and PLx Pharma Inc.

Compared to these stocks Wrap Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:WRAP) is even less popular than THM. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for WRAP is 22.1. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Hedge funds clearly dropped the ball on WRAP as the stock delivered strong returns, though hedge funds' consensus picks still generated respectable returns.

While hospitals have been using UV-C lights for decades to disinfect operating rooms, the technology was not widely adopted because the machinery was expensive, said Ben Boyer, a co-founder of R-Zero. R-Zero, formed in April last year, makes its UV-C light banks on wheels in San Jose. The company said it has booked $15 million in sales to schools, restaurants, senior care facilities, sports arenas and jails, through a subscription model that starts at $17 a day. It plans to unveil a suite of sensors and a small, safe UV-C light machine that turns on automatically when people are in the room, an improvement over its current UV-C light product that turns off when someone enters the room. The company uses software to collect the data and automate the whole process, said Boyer. Boyer said he is confident that a pirate or legacy UV-C maker could not compete with R-Zero even if it was able to replicate some of the company's devices. \u201cSystems are very hard to copy,\" he said. Ira Ehrenpreis an early investor in Tesla Inc and SpaceX who first invested in R-Zero last year, said technology is disrupting the cleaning industry. \u201cThe idea of taking an approach that has been terrible for our planet and equally terrible for the applicators or the folks that have not had a voice to speak up for themselves\u201d and eliminating the chemicals from it, said Ehrenpreis, fit with the goal of his venture capital firm DBL Partners.

The automaker today announced plans to electrify its entire vehicle lineup by 2030. It also pledged that half of its global volume will be zero-emission vehicles by 2025. Before then, Lincoln will debut its first fully electric car next year to coincide with its centenary.\u00a0 Ford recently earmarked $30 billion for electric vehicles as part of its plan to go all-electric in Europe by 2030. The ambitious strategy, dubbed Ford Plus, sees the US auto giant trying to catch up to rivals General Motors, Volkswagen and Tesla in the shift to electrification. In May, Ford announced that it was working on all-electric versions of its Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs, along with two EV platforms respectively built for full-size trucks and all- and rear-wheel drive models.\u00a0 Today, Lincoln said its electrification goals fall under the Ford Plus umbrella. The company plans to utilize the EV platform for multiple vehicle types for four new fully electric cars. An electric charging network, underpinned by Electrify America's charging infrastructure and additional partners, is also in the works and will be accessible through the Lincoln Way app.\u00a0 The raft of announcements, including connected driving and tech upgrades (more on those below), follow Lincoln's decision to scrap its Rivian-based electric SUV due to complications caused by the pandemic. In terms of design, Lincoln's Zephyr Reflection concept, unveiled at the Auto Shanghai show in April, will serve as an aesthetical blueprint for future EV models, the company said. Though that Sedan is aimed at China, Lincoln will borrow its coast-to-coast display for its fully electric vehicle, with plans to update its Star logo and provide the kind of roomy interior you'd expect from its luxury output. Alongside the electric makeover, Lincoln is also working on a major tech upgrade for its lineup. The plans include a cloud-based Lincoln Intelligence System for connected vehicles, which will allow it to deliver iterative software updates for battery, power and computing systems. While newer models with Ford's Sync 4 infotainment system will receive continuous updates through the Lincoln Enhance platform. That includes the Lincoln Nautilus, which is due for its first update this summer, including improvements to the navigation system, Apple CarPlay and digital owner's manual. Later this fall, an additional update will provide enhancements for Amazon's Alexa digital assistant. In addition, the company will soon roll out ActiveGlide, a hands-free driving assistance feature that only works on sections of divided highways. It follows Ford's unveiling of its BlueCruise tech, destined for vehicles with Ford Co-Pilot360 (like the Mustang Mach-E) in the second half of the year via a Snyc 4 software update. Similar to GM's Super Cruise, Ford's feature can be operated on 100,000 miles of divided highways in the US and Canada. Further down the line, Lincoln plans to equip its future vehicles with a new Android Auto-powered digital platform. A Rejuvenation mode is also in the works that lets owners tinker with the display, lighting, massage, audio and even scent features to boost their wellbeing. Lincoln previously partnered with meditation app Calm to offer customers a year of its premium service through the Lincoln Way app. "}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "title": "Former U.S. Ambassador throws support behind embattled Toshiba board chair ", "url": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/former-u-ambassador-throws-support-014647473.html", "date": "Sat, 19 Jun 2021 01:46:47 GMT", "content": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan John Roos on Saturday endorsed the continued leadership of Toshiba Corp Board Chairman Osamu Nagayama, who has come under intense pressure to resign amid a deepening crisis at the Japanese conglomerate.

(NASDAQ:DYAI), worth close to $2.1 million, amounting to 0.2% of its total 13F portfolio. On Portolan Capital Management's heels is Bandera Partners, managed by Gregory Bylinsky and Jefferson Gramm, which holds a $0.5 million position; 0.2% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the company. Some other professional money managers with similar optimism include Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group, Renaissance Technologies and John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Bandera Partners allocated the biggest weight to Dyadic International, Inc. (NASDAQ:DYAI), around 0.2% of its 13F portfolio. Portolan Capital Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 0.17 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to DYAI. Seeing as Dyadic International, Inc. (NASDAQ:DYAI) has witnessed declining sentiment from the aggregate hedge fund industry, it's easy to see that there is a sect of money managers that elected to cut their entire stakes by the end of the first quarter. At the top of the heap, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group dumped the biggest stake of the \"upper crust\" of funds followed by Insider Monkey, worth about $0.1 million in stock. Israel Englander's fund, Millennium Management, also sold off its stock, about $0.1 million worth. These transactions are important to note, as total hedge fund interest fell by 1 funds by the end of the first quarter. Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Dyadic International, Inc. (NASDAQ:DYAI) but similarly valued. These stocks are X4 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:XFOR), First Community Corporation (NASDAQ:FCCO), Lyra Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYRA), Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:PSTI), Aspen Group Inc. (NASDAQ:ASPU), Immutep Limited (NASDAQ:IMMP), and Power REIT (NYSE:PW). All of these stocks' market caps match DYAI's market cap.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 5 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $23 million. That figure was $3 million in DYAI's case. X4 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:XFOR) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand First Community Corporation (NASDAQ:FCCO) is the least popular one with only 2 bullish hedge fund positions. Dyadic International, Inc. (NASDAQ:DYAI) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for DYAI is 30.1. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th and surpassed the market again by 3.3 percentage points. Unfortunately DYAI wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); DYAI investors were disappointed as the stock returned -33% since the end of March (through 6/11) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

Investors view bitcoin as the second most crowded traded (investors love bitcoin perhaps too much) behind being long commodities.\u00a0 A total of 224 fund managers with $667 billion in assets under management participated in the survey. To be sure, bitcoin prices have had a rough go of it lately as investors seemingly fixate on every bearish tweet from crypto influencer Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\u00a0 Bitcoin prices plunged roughly 37% in May, and are down 38% from their mid-April peak of $64,829. Prices have received a boost this week from bullish comments by money manager Paul Tudor Jones, who called bitcoin a good portfolio diversifier. At $40,000 though, bitcoin prices remain not too far removed from the early June lows of around $33,000. Meanwhile, others on Wall Street are warning the downside risk in bitcoin continues to be high. J.P. Morgan strategist and bitcoin expert Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou argued recently that medium-term fair value for bitcoin is in the $24,000 to $36,000 range. The analyst thinks the May crash in bitcoin has badly weakened institutional demand, which is likely to keep prices under pressure for the near-term. \"There is little doubt that the boom and bust dynamics of the past weeks represent a setback to the institutional adoption of crypto markets and in particular of Bitcoin and Ethereum. We note that the mere rise in volatility, especially relative to gold, is an impediment to further institutional adoption as it reduces the attractiveness of digital gold vs. traditional gold in institutional portfolios,\" Panigirtzoglou said.

Most investors who decided to stick with hedge funds after a rough 2018 recouped their losses by the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. A significant number of hedge funds continued their strong performance in 2020 and 2021 as well. We get to see hedge funds' thoughts towards the market and individual stocks by aggregating their quarterly portfolio movements and reading their investor letters. In this article, we will particularly take a look at what hedge funds think about Gold Standard Ventures Corp (NYSE:GSV). Gold Standard Ventures Corp (NYSE:GSV) investors should pay attention to a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money lately. Gold Standard Ventures Corp (NYSE:GSV) was in 4 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 8. Our calculations also showed that GSV isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Hedge funds have more than $3.5 trillion in assets under management, so you can't expect their entire portfolios to beat the market by large margins. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). So you can still find a lot of gems by following hedge funds' moves today. Eric Sprott of Sprott Asset Management At Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, an activist hedge fund wants to buy this $27 biotech stock for $50. So, we recommended a long position to our monthly premium newsletter subscribers. We go through lists like the 10 best battery stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return.

Keeping this in mind let's take a glance at the recent hedge fund action surrounding Gold Standard Ventures Corp (NYSE:GSV). At the end of the first quarter, a total of 4 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -50% from the previous quarter. By comparison, 4 hedge funds held shares or bullish call options in GSV a year ago. With the smart money's capital changing hands, there exists an \"upper tier\" of notable hedge fund managers who were increasing their holdings substantially (or already accumulated large positions). According to Insider Monkey's hedge fund database, Peter Franklin Palmedo's Sun Valley Gold has the largest position in Gold Standard Ventures Corp (NYSE:GSV), worth close to $21 million, corresponding to 7.5% of its total 13F portfolio. Sitting at the No. 2 spot is Sprott Asset Management, managed by Eric Sprott, which holds a $1.8 million position; the fund has 0.1% of its 13F portfolio invested in the stock. Remaining members of the smart money that are bullish consist of Ali Motamed's Invenomic Capital Management, Israel Englander's Millennium Management and . In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Sun Valley Gold allocated the biggest weight to Gold Standard Ventures Corp (NYSE:GSV), around 7.45% of its 13F portfolio. Sprott Asset Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, setting aside 0.11 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to GSV. Seeing as Gold Standard Ventures Corp (NYSE:GSV) has experienced a decline in interest from hedge fund managers, it's safe to say that there were a few hedgies who were dropping their full holdings last quarter. Intriguingly, John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors dumped the biggest investment of all the hedgies followed by Insider Monkey, comprising close to $0.1 million in stock, and Mark Broach's Manatuck Hill Partners was right behind this move, as the fund dropped about $0.1 million worth. These moves are important to note, as aggregate hedge fund interest was cut by 4 funds last quarter. Let's also examine hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Gold Standard Ventures Corp (NYSE:GSV) but similarly valued. These stocks are RigNet Inc (NASDAQ:RNET), Velocity Financial, Inc. (NYSE:VEL), scPharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:SCPH), RGC Resources, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Burry\u2019s history and hedge fund performance, and go directly to 5 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy According to Michael Burry. The famous Big Short investor and Scion Asset Management chief Michael Burry\u2019s prediction about the inflation numbers turned out to be true as reports suggested that daily goods products prices soared sharply in the past couple of months. He had predicted the post-pandemic inflationary pressure last year when the US imposed the first lockdown and the Fed had started easing the monetary policy. The Big Short investor, who is famous for accurately predicting the US housing collapse and making a billion-dollar bet on that, believes the stock market will feel pressure ahead. \"When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store,\" he said. Burry, 49, not only expressed concerns over the rising inflation, which he believes would significantly reduce the value of the dollar, he said early this year that the stock market was \"dancing on a knife's edge\" and marked Tesla, GameStop, bitcoin, and Robinhood as examples of dangerous speculation in markets. \"Each $ of earnings today becomes important,\" he tweeted on February 23. \"Earnings 10 and 20 years from now, the corollary goes, may be worth substantially less tomorrow's today,\" Burry said. Micheal Burry, who pledged to stop tweeting in mid-March amid regulatory concerns and deleted his Twitter account in April, has one of the best stock-picking skills among hedge fund managers. In one of his recent interviews, he expressed how he predicted the housing collapse: \"We bought basically short $8.4 billion of credit default swaps related to mortgages or financial companies. We had a giant bet for us, and I was extremely confident in the outcome. I know for sure that some of them(investors) thought I lost my mind. A lot of clients were just glad to be done with it at the end. Perhaps I had made the trade too big for the fund, and my confidence in the trade had ticked off some people. Even if it's remarkable, there are investors who made tens of millions off this. We're still pretty upset.\" During the first quarter of this year, Michael Burry\u2019s Scion Asset Management made several portfolio adjustments in the light of market trends. He surprised investors with his more than $500 million in a short position on the California-based electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA). Elon Musk's Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)'s stock price has been under pressure over the past few months amid increasing competition, lower than expected delivery growth, and higher multiples. The shares of the largest EV maker owned by billionaire Elon Musk are down close to 30% from its February peak.  Burry, who lost his one eye due to cancer when he was only two years old, is a pure value investor as he likes to capitalize on short-term price movement. This is reflected in his strategy of buying a stake in Wells Fargo Corporation (NYSE: WFC) during the fourth quarter of 2020 and then selling the entire position in the first quarter. Similarly, The Big Short investor sold out his Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) position in the first quarter of 2021 after holding the position for two quarters. According to first-quarter 13F filings, Michael Burry initiated positions in 23 stocks and added to 4 existing positions. On the other hand, his hedge fund sold 15 stock positions during the first quarter of 2021. Some of the stocks in which Burry is bullish on as of the end of the first quarter include CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS), Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY), Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB) and SunCoke Energy Inc (NYSE: SXC). The Big Short investor, who believes speculative buying and borrowed money has pushed the stock market into a dangerous position, is betting big on energy stocks. At the end of the first quarter, his hedge fund has raised the energy sector weighting to 29.66% of the overall portfolio compared to 14% in the prior quarter. The main idea behind racking up energy shares is to enjoy the economic recovery period. Burry\u2019s bet moved in the right direction as the energy sector topped the broader market index since the beginning of this year, with a 30.8% return in the first quarter of 2021.  Michael Burry of Scion Asset Management While Michael Burry's reputation remains intact, the same can\u2019t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn\u2019t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey\u2019s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017.

Interestingly, Alex Sacerdote's Whale Rock Capital Management dropped the biggest position of all the hedgies followed by Insider Monkey, worth about $353.9 million in stock, and James Crichton's Hitchwood Capital Management was right behind this move, as the fund said goodbye to about $27.7 million worth. These moves are intriguing to say the least, as total hedge fund interest fell by 5 funds in the first quarter. Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) but similarly valued. These stocks are Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK), Vale SA (NYSE:VALE), British American Tobacco plc (NYSE:BTI), Anthem Inc (NYSE:ANTM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (NYSE:FIS). This group of stocks' market values are closest to ZM's market value.

The company has invested more than $6 million in the 200,000-square foot facility expansion, giving Fehrer a total of 500,000 square feet of space in Gadsden \u2014 quadruple the company's footprint when it first opened a decade ago.  Fehrer Gadsden also employs approximately 500 people, making it the second-largest foam plant in the Fehrer Group worldwide and one of the largest employers in Etowah County.  \"While this expansion will only for now create 15 more jobs, for us more importantly, it frees up space in the original production site to bring more production\u2026 into Gadsden and create even more opportunities,\" Matthias Goetz, General Manager of Fehrer's Gadsden plant, said during remarks Wednesday.  The Fehrer Group is one of the worldwide leading specialists for vehicle interior components, and the Gadsden plant began by supplying Mercedes Benz in Tuscaloosa and Volkswagen in Chattanooga with two production lines.  Over the last 10 years, Fehrer has added five more production lines and more customers, including Tesla, BMW, a Mercedes Benz plant in Charleston, South Carolina, and the Commercial Vehicle Group (CVG). The acquisition of the new Mercedes electric SUV in Tuscaloosa and the Volkswagen electric vehicle in Chattanooga offers further future opportunities for Fehrer Gadsden.  Thomas Mueller, head of Central Operational Services for Fehrer, gave some insight into the company's future, which includes focusing on the North American market and expanding production capacities in the U.S. \"The add-on here in our facility in Gadsden fits perfectly in our picture,\" Mueller said. \"We will work hard to fill up the rest of the building with projects.\"  The City of Gadsden and Fehrer Automotive will continue to work together to improve the quality of life for citizens and the business environment in Gadsden and Etowah County.  \"This investment shows the commitment from the Fehrer stakeholders and the owner group not just to its current employees, but also to the City of Gadsden as a strategic point worldwide,\" Goetz said. \"I'm glad to have Fehrer in Gadsden, and we look forward to continuing to work with them on future projects,\" said Gadsden Mayor Sherman Guyton. \"One of my personal goals is to work closely with the City, the local board of industrial development and schools to make sure that we are ready for expansion and that we have a skilled, trained and well-developed workforce,\" Goetz said.  The Hollingsworth Company has played an important role in making Fehrer's Gadsden plant a reality, and speakers thanked Tom Mann, Sr. VP of Industrial Real Estate, at Wednesday's event. The plant's employees are another essential part of the past and future success of Fehrer Gadsden. \"Their hard work and dedication every day is the cornerstone for the success of this plant,\" Goetz said.

The agency had already confirmed some specific Tesla crash investigations but had not previously released to Reuters a full accounting of all Tesla crashes investigated where Tesla's Autopilot system was suspected of being involved. Of the 30 Tesla crashes, NHTSA has ruled out Tesla's Autopilot in three and published reports on two of the crashes. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters first sought a full list from NHTSA more than a year ago under a public records request. The list only includes the state and month the crashes occurred. Previously, NHTSA said it had opened 28 special crash investigations into Tesla crashes, with 24 pending. The spreadsheet shows a February 2019 crash where Autopilot use was undetermined. Autopilot, which handles some driving tasks, was operating in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has said. The NTSB has criticized Tesla's lack of system safeguards for Autopilot, which allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods. The spreadsheet shows NHTSA has opened eight investigations into Tesla crashes since March. The issue has gotten new attention after a fiery April 17 Texas crash that killed two men in Texas in which police had said they believed no one was behind the wheel. The National Transportation Safety Board said in May that testing suggested the vehicle's automated steering system was \"not available\" on the road where the accident occurred. On Wednesday, Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell cited Tesla crashes as the panel voted against moving ahead with regulations to speed the adoption of self-driving cars. \"It seems like every other week we're hearing about a new vehicle that crashed when it was on Autopilot\" Cantwell said. Separately, NHTSA has conducted no new tests after it withdrew its designation last month that some newer Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles as having four advanced safety features after the automaker said it was removing radar sensors to transition to a camera-based Autopilot system. The agency said Thursday that after discussions with Tesla it restored the lane departure warning designation after Tesla confirmed the technology was unaffected. NHTSA said in a statement it has \"not yet finalized the list of Model Year 2022 vehicles\" for testing. The spreadsheet also notes NHTSA has opened six other investigations into six other crashes involving driver assistance systems, including two involving Cadillac vehicles in which there were no reported injuries. The other four include two involved a 2012 Lexus RX450H and 2017 Navya Arma in which there were no reported injuries. The remaining two involved 2017 Volvo XC90 vehicles, including an Uber Technologies self-driving test vehicle that struck and killed a woman in Arizona in 2018. Uber made a series of development decisions that contributed to the crash's cause and deactivated the automatic emergency braking systems in the Volvo XC90 vehicle, safety investigators found.

What may be lying beneath the surface of this still impressive performance from the disruptors is that the old implicit rule for business \u2013 the alleged trade off between profitability and the environmental responsibility \u2013 is less true today than in the history of the auto sector. In the last decade, success in the auto sector was based less on improving environmental impacts of the products they built (most all the impact is from product use), and more based on the need to satisfy consumers\u2019 insatiable demand to go bigger \u2013 supersize me with an SUV (and let\u2019s not focus on the carbon footprint): And many of these gas-guzzling SUVs are still in the legacy OEM product pipelines and will be on the road for years to come. But, times are changing, driven largely by three realities. Climate change is really coming, faster than we thought and with more devastating consequences sooner than we thought. This is a reality defined by physics and chemistry, not politics. Second, electric vehicle drivers are finding EVs to be superior in just about every respect compared to fossil fuel driven vehicles. EVs are better, cleaner and becoming cheaper. According to a new study by researchers at the University of California Davis, four out of five EV drivers surveyed in California say they would not go back. The only flaws (range and charging) are rapidly being addressed. Third, regulators, most acutely in the EU, are making it increasingly costly for firms based or doing business there to delay transformation. Some of the auto majors saw this fact coming several years ago and began repositioning. They would no longer be able to externalise the harms of their products. Not only were the regulators getting serious, but an increasing number of buyers were finding a preferred alternative that didn\u2019t have those negative externalities. Volkswagen, the largest of the auto-sector mega-fauna, is perhaps the best example given its massive scale and current fleet, which is still 95% fossil fuel driven cars and SUVs. Recent announcements of R&D spend signal a seismic shift in priorities, with roughly 50% of spend ($86bn) over the next five years allocated to EVs and related technology. And VW has already seen rewards from the marketplace, with much of the return emerging alongside their EV plans. In addition to Volkswagen, there are what we at Signal Climate Analytics call legacy transition opportunity leaders (EU-based companies like Daimler, and BMW, which have had aggressive growth plans for EVs over the past two years), and risers (companies like Ford, Kia, Hyundai, which have recently made a major shift toward a more aggressive EV strategy). Both leaders and risers have seen a remarkable recovery in their shareholder performance, just as there has been a bit of a retrenchment among disruptors. In the accompanying graph we rank auto makers by \u201cSustainable Value Ratio\uf0e4\u201d or SVR. The SVR is a measure of the readiness of a firm to optimise opportunity and minimise risk in making the transition to lower carbon products and processes. The legacy leaders and risers (blue box below) are demonstrating, through a combination of skilled management and a motivated labour force, that they are prepared to go head to head with the disruptors. They are currently behind but have a real advantage in knowing how to scale up. With a level of customer enthusiasm for EVs strong among current owners, the recent big positive swings in shareholder value among legacy automakers poised to go big with EV production may be signalling that investors and analysts are now paying close attention to the readiness of automakers to optimise the coming EV opportunity, and minimise their fossil-fuel product risks. If that is indeed what we are seeing in these numbers, then this will be one of the first signals that the new business logic of growth and profitability through de-carbonization (innovations that deliver the customer value proposition with reduced environmental harms) is beginning to factor into the value assessments, as we are seeing in other carbon-intensive sectors like energy and utilities, which will also be key to auto sector decarbonisation. In boardrooms of the world\u2019s oldest and best-known legacy automakers, directors have watched in awe as this new generation of automotive \u2018disruptors\u2019, exemplified by Tesla, have seized the imagination and capital of seasoned investors and stock market enthusiasts alike. They have had the innovation lane all to themselves. But the automotive \u201cdinosaurs\u201d can now be spotted in the rear-view mirror of those disruptors. And they are catching up, with many now staking their claims to that same piece of the road. In the words of Jim Farley, Ford\u2019s CEO since 2019: \u201cThe electrification of the industry is a big change, and I think it wasn\u2019t clear until we launched Lightning and Mach E that Ford was going to be a winner in this new electric reality \u2026 Now investors are betting on Ford, and what they\u2019re telling me is, \u2018The strategy is attractive, Go execute it, Farley\u2019.\u201d Making an EV vehicle that draws raves from its drivers is becoming \u201cdoable\u201d for the transition leaders and risers among the legacy automakers. It may be that as EV production finally starts to take off several old companies will have a chance to become the new \u201cstory\u201d stocks, capturing a disproportionate share of the valuation gains with strategies that finally break the profit vs environment trade-off.

As part of that spending, the No. 1 U.S. automaker will build two additional U.S. battery plants and move ahead some of its EV investments, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. In November, GM upped its spending plans from $20 billion, a figure that was announced in March before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the auto industry.  The Detroit company declined to comment. In addition, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other key Democrats to discuss EVs and vehicle emissions, the sources said. Barra will also meet U.S. Representative Richard Neal, head of the tax policy Ways and Means Committee, Frank Pallone, who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, and two key Michigan Democrats: Representatives Dan Kildee and Debbie Dingell, the sources said.

GM's ability to benefit from the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit has expired. GM has sparred with Democrats over vehicle emissions rules, but last week said it supported overall emissions reductions in California's 2019 deal with other major automakers. It has also sought more flexibility to hit carbon reduction target between now and 2026. The Associated Press reported on Monday that GM planned to announce two new U.S. battery plants, citing comments by President Mark Reuss. GM confirmed the executive's comments, but sources said the company has not decided where in the United States to build the plants, which are each expected to cost more than $2 billion. GM confirmed in November it would speed up the rollout of new EVs, with plans to offer 30 models globally by 2025, up from a prior target of 20 by 2023. Barra said the automaker wants to exceed annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025. The bill also includes a 30% tax credit for manufacturers to retool or build new facilities to produce advanced energy technologies including batteries. That would represent a big boost to GM\u2019s battery factory plans.

Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters in a telephone interview that the Polestar 3 is \"nicely suited for the U.S. as a ... big, tall, grown-up SUV. This is a win-win situation.\" The Volvo plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina, near Charleston, currently builds the Volvo S60 sedan and will add the Volvo XC90 SUV in 2022, Polestar said on Wednesday. The annual capacity at the plant, which opened in 2018, will be 150,000 vehicles with the Volvo and Polestar SUVs added, a Volvo spokesman said. Sweden's Volvo Cars is owned by Geely. The Polestar SUV will initially be sold in the United States, but could eventually be exported, Ingenlath said. Polestar, which was launched in 2017, sells the low-volume halo Polestar 1 hybrid performance car for about $155,000. Its first high-volume car, the Polestar 2, sells for about $60,000. Both cars are built in China. Ingenlath said last year Polestar was targeting annual Polestar 2 sales of more than 50,000 vehicles within two to three years. He said that goal has not changed, but declined to give volume targets for the Polestar 3. The company also is developing a larger, more environmentally friendly sedan called Precept and will build that vehicle at a new plant in China.  Ingenlath said taking Polestar public remained a possibility, but the focus is on raising funds to help the company grow. Last year he said Polestar would like eventually to be publicly listed.

Perhaps the definitive sign that crypto for the masses has arrived and is here to stay is the fact that Bitcoin and Dogecoin whisperer, Elon Musk, recently hosted Saturday Night Live, which also parodied NFTs. Earlier this year, Tesla announced it was investing $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, adding momentum to a wave of corporate and institutional investments in cryptocurrencies. According to Gemini's recently released 2021 State of U.S. Crypto Report, more than 21 million adults own cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, and the number of crypto investors is projected to double this year. The rapid and widespread adoption of crypto and digital assets at the corporate, institutional and individual level is outpacing the existing legal frameworks that apply to digital assets, causing confusion and frustration for market participants. There are many legal and regulatory issues related to trading and investing in digital assets, including securities and commodities law concerns, custody issues, trading terms, know-your-customer and anti-money laundering requirements, reporting requirements, and intellectual property as well as tax and accounting issues. Regulations differ based on jurisdiction and, in some cases, the characteristics and use of a particular digital asset. In the United States, a threshold regulatory question for digital assets is whether the asset is a security or commodity. The rules for each category are different, as are the primary regulators, with securities being regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and derivatives related to commodities being regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The classification of digital assets as securities has wide-ranging implications for the regulatory obligations that flow from the offer, sale, trading and clearing of such assets. Platforms that bring together purchasers and sellers to trade digital assets that are securities in the United States are generally subject to registration as exchanges or alternative trading systems. Individuals or entities facilitating clearing and settlement of securities may be subject to registration with the SEC as a clearing agency, and individuals or entities that effect transactions in digital assets that are securities in the United States may be subject to registration with the SEC and in certain states as a \"broker\" or \"dealer.\" After registering, the individuals or entities would be subject to continued regulation by the SEC and applicable states. It is likely that many initial coin offerings (ICOs) will constitute offerings of securities under the prevailing \"Howey Test\" used by the SEC to determine whether digital assets constitute securities. In short, if the digital asset can be characterized as an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others, it likely qualifies as a security under SEC precedents. Digital assets that constitute securities are subject to the applicable regulatory requirements for all publicly traded securities, including disclosure requirements and rules for public and private offering and selling, as well as investing and trading in, such digital assets. An important regulator to watch is former CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler who recently took the reins as SEC Chairman. Gensler has extensive expertise in this space and previously served as Co-Director of MIT's FinTech Initiative and Senior Advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative. Market watchers are eagerly awaiting the SEC's decision on whether to allow exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are linked to Bitcoin and other digital assets. If approved, such a move will exponentially increase both retail and institutional participation in the space. However, approval is far from certain, especially after Gensler testified before Congress in early May about how the crypto market \"could benefit from greater investor protection.\" The CFTC is the federal agency responsible for regulating U.S. commodity futures, option and swap markets. CFTC regulations will apply to digital assets that are not securities, depending on the type of product and the type of transaction conducted. Some digital assets, such as Bitcoin, were designed for the sole function of value exchange, while other digital assets facilitate transactions such as smart contracts or particular activities on purpose-built networks. For example, Ether via Ethereum allows for the payment of certain computation costs associated with executing smart contracts. Popular digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether are considered to be commodities from a regulatory perspective, and therefore futures, option, swap or other derivative transactions relating to those assets fall under the CFTC's jurisdiction. The CFTC generally does not regulate spot transactions in commodities, although such transactions are subject to CFTC prohibitions on fraud and manipulation. While some countries have a centralized agency that regulates (or potentially could regulate) all digital assets \u2014 for example, the UK Financial Conduct Authority \u2014 in the U.S. we have an \"alphabet soup\" of rules and regulators, each with a distinct mission. For example, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) is a comprehensive federal anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing statute requiring that certain financial institutions (e.g., banks, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, money services businesses and casinos) implement \"know your customer\" (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) programs. Enforcement of the BSA is led by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is the bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury responsible for combating money laundering. Under the BSA, financial institutions and money service businesses (MSBs) must register with FinCEN, prepare a written AML compliance program, and file BSA reports for suspicious activity and currency transactions. Other BSA requirements relate to record-keeping for certain transactions and obtaining customer ID information. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), SEC and FINRA as well as state agencies, depending on the type of transaction and institution involved, regulate the custody of digital assets. Custody is a particularly tricky issue as it relates to digital assets with the tension focused on ease of access (e.g., hot wallets and omnibus accounts) versus strength of security (e.g., cold wallets and multi-factor authentication protocols). Examples of custody legal issues include establishing an operation under appropriate legal framework, like a state-licensed trust company, achieving Qualified Custodian status under federal law, access issues and limitations on liability. At the state level, there are 50 attorneys general and various state agencies that enforce digital asset-related laws (or other general laws that may apply to digital assets) passed by state legislatures and applied by the courts. Individual states are taking different approaches, and the laboratory of ideas is actively at work. For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services has enacted the Virtual Currency Business Activity regulatory framework (e.g., the \"BitLicense\" framework), which covers substantially all virtual currency activity by New York firms and residents. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Wyoming has passed legislation exempting virtual currency transactions from its money transmitter regulations, utility tokens from certain state securities registration and money transmitter laws and virtual currencies from property taxation laws. And Colorado recently issued guidance exempting certain types of digital asset exchanges from the state's money transmitter licensing requirements. It remains unsettled whether federal regulation will supersede state regulation in respect of digital assets and FinTech more generally, as the courts have not yet ruled on many aspects of crypto regulation. Increasingly, cryptocurrency and digital assets are looking less and less like a trend that will fall out of fashion and more like an important part of the future of finance. China is aggressively pushing its new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the digital Yuan, and the UK and US are actively exploring their own CBDC initiatives. In the private sector, PayPal will soon allow customers to pay using cryptocurrency at more than 29 million online stores, and many major banks are rolling out crypto wallets and offering digital asset options to their customers. Whether as a store of value, medium of exchange, or digital representation of a physical asset, the possibilities presented by digital assets for reimagining the financial system, who has access and how they participate, is wide open. In the next column, we will look at some use cases for digital assets, what FinTech start-ups have been focused on, and what this means for financial institutions and other incumbents in the space.

The committee rebuffed the bid by Republican Senator John Thune to attach measures lifting regulations on autonomous vehicles to a $78 billion surface transportation bill after he sought last month to attach it in May to a bill on China tech policy. Thune has proposed granting the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the power to grant exemptions for tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles per manufacturer from safety standards written with human drivers in mind. The surface bill, which would boost funding for Amtrak and other transportation needs, was approved by the committee on a 25-3 vote. Thune and other lawmakers have sought for nearly five years to win approval. The senator argued autonomous vehicles could help eliminate numerous deaths due to human error like distracted or impaired drivers. Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, cited recent Tesla crashes and other recent incidents involving driver assistance systems in her response. \"It seems like every other week we're hearing about a new vehicle that crashed when it was on Autopilot\" Cantwell said. \"I do think this is legislation that we can complete by the end of this year... These last issues are very thorny as it relates to legal structure.\" \"Democrats have yielded to pressure from special interests against the best interests of our economy and the American people,\" Thune said. \"Are we really going to continue to ignore the enormous safety benefits of these vehicles?\" Thune said that the \"Teamsters and trial lawyers\" are opposed to self-driving legislation and they \"seem to own lock, stock and barrel the Democrats on this committee.\" The Teamsters did not immediately comment. The American Association for Justice, which represents plaintiffs lawyers said it \"will continue to oppose any legislation that exempts the driverless car industry from basic safety standards, and allows auto and tech companies to avoid being held accountable through the use of forced arbitration clauses.\" Last month, Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department for the AFL-CIO, told U.S. lawmakers that autonomous vehicles place \"millions of jobs at risk\" and any self-driving legislation should not apply to commercial trucks. Reuters reported in May that Waymo and rival Cruise, a unit of General Motors,  have applied for permits to start charging for rides and delivery using autonomous vehicles in San Francisco.

It is also developing hydrogen fuel-cell-powered locomotives.  The 430,000-pound electric locomotive, with a battery capacity of 2.4 megawatt hours (MWh), uses 18,000 lithium-ion battery cells, Wabtec's chief technology officer, Eric Gebhardt, said in a recent interview.

Equities in Europe look set to nudge up and stay around yesterday\u2019s fresh historic peaks as the recovery-induced trade displays its full potential, and Wall Street too is poised for a positive start after yet another record close. Volatility gauges on both sides of the Atlantic have dipped to new pre-pandemic lows and bond yields across developed counties are moving around the mid point of the last three months\u2019 trading range, illustrating the fairly relaxed mood. The two-day Federal Reserve meeting kicks off today and although it is not expected to announce any plan to pare its bond purchases it may offer hints the discussion has began, amid some concerns about growing inflationary pressures. JP Morgan said the upcoming tapering process was unlikely to hurt its bullish view on equities for the second half of 2021. It expects the Fed to start tapering early next year. Back to today\u2019s agenda, investors will keep an eye on a number of ECB speakers but that comes after abundant reassurances - the latest from president Lagarde yesterday - that it\u2019s too early to even talk about withdrawing support. And in Asia Pacific, similar soundings came from Australia, where its central bank members said in the June meeting\u2019s minutes that it was too early to end the bank\u2019s bond buying programme. Meantime in Japan a former Bank of Japan policymaker said the bank must eventually consider ways to unload its huge holdings of exchange-traded funds after tapering bond and ETF purchases. But the timing will be years away. On the corporate front, the U.S. and Europe are expected to announce a truce in their 17-year-old dispute over aircraft subsidies on Tuesday. That could help planemakers Boeing and Airbus and also bring relief to other industries. Good news also on the COVID-19 front.

It's an unexpected priority. Nickel isn't on the U.S. list of critical minerals. Although the country depends on imports, 68% of supplies come from what the report calls \"allied nations\" such as Canada, Australia, Norway and Finland. But the Department of Energy (DOE) has identified Class 1 nickel, the type best suited to lithium-ion batteries, as both key vulnerability and key opportunity. The emphasis on nickel doesn't mean the White House is complacent about other critical battery materials such as lithium and cobalt but it says a lot about how the administration is thinking about the problem. LOW RESERVES, NO PROCESSING The United States is import-dependent across the spectrum of battery metals with large parts of the supply chain captured by China, a problematic international trading partner. However, the nature of the dependency differs by mineral, starting in the ground. The United States, for example, \"has lithium resources and domestic corporations well-versed in recovery and refinement globally\", according to the report. The ambition, therefore, is to stimulate more domestic mining and, even more importantly, domestic processing through a potential mix of purchasing guarantees, federal funding and research and development into enhanced recovery technology. China's investment in this section of the supply chain \"has made them the world's leader despite limited domestic lithium supply\", the report notes. When it comes to nickel, however, the only active U.S. mine - Eagle in Michigan - is due to retire in 2025 and domestic deposits are small and low grade. There is no domestic nickel processing capacity outside a limited amount of by-product salt production. Yet this particular battery metal is the one likely to experience the most significant demand increase over the coming years, the report says, with \"market indications that there could be a large shortage of Class 1 nickel in the next 3-7 years\". Indeed, with nickel content rising in battery cathode design, not having enough of the right kind of nickel \"poses a supply chain risk for battery manufacturing globally, not just in the United States\". RE-DESIGNING DEMAND Nickel demand is rising because automakers are trying to reduce their usage of cobalt, a metal that is overshadowed by a supply-chain reliance on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its artisanal workforce. The Department of Energy wants to help them with a commitment to \"a multi-year initiative to address the scientific and engineering issues with reducing and eliminating the cobalt in EV batteries\". Research is already taking place into new materials such as  silicon and lithium metal anodes with progress to date \"very good\", the report says. The DOE awarded cobalt the \"lowest 'quality' supply chain score of all elements, largely due to the alleged mining conditions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and conditions surrounding cobalt refining in China\". But with most of the world's known cobalt reserves in the Congo, there's an acceptance that short-term risks can only be partly mitigated through a combination of maximising domestic resources, particularly old tailings, and working with allied countries. The report recommends using the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to \"identify projects in allied and partner nations that can be funded to create new sustainable mining and processing operations for lithium, graphite, and other key metals and materials\". RECYCLING Also critical to reducing critical minerals dependence will be building recycling capacity, according to the DOE. Battery recycling could meet up to 30% of nickel and 80% of cobalt usage in electric vehicles by the end of the decade but there are multiple hurdles in getting there. It will require a national recycling policy to align a sector that is currently fragmented by state legislation. Without one batteries will go to landfill or be exported to other countries where the metals will be extracted. It will also need more research and development on how to recycle electric vehicle batteries because it's currently unprofitable in many cases and is becoming more chemically difficult as battery ingredients multiply. Ideally, it should take place in tandem with a build-out of other parts of the battery supply chain such as cell and pack manufacture, allowing \"new\" scrap to be continuously looped back into the production process. The report recommends the United States should form a cross-agency task force to \"capture a holistic view of the opportunity landscape and to coordinate action to support domestic recycling\". Despite the long list of challenges, the DOE concludes that recycled material can \"buffer volume and price instabilities\" in the short term and, as ever more EV batteries reach end-of-life, \"could eventually supply a significant share of critical battery material needs\". NICKEL URGENCY Recycling will likely help close the U.S. dependency gap faster in cobalt than it will in nickel. This is because the current recyclables stream is largely made up of consumer electronics and first-generation EVs, neither of which contain much nickel. The world is going to need a lot more new nickel before recycling can make a real impact. There is a nickel mining and processing boom underway in Indonesia but rather than offering any comfort to the United States, the dominance of Chinese players simply means the country risks \"falling further behind China in this critical mineral\". As such, \"there is urgency to developing a strategy around Class 1 nickel\", the report concludes. Starting with a U.S.-funded nickel processing plant.

Beyond EV pioneer and market leader Tesla, virtually every major auto manufacturer is lining up to flip the e-switch and it is not just a big deal for consumers, but the thousands of auto dealerships across the country that will need to embrace the electric future. General Motors has said it's aiming to produce only EVs by 2035, with 30 new plug-in models arriving by 2025, marking a $27-billion investment. Ford, which previously committed $22 billion to EV development, just announced that 40% of its vehicles will be electrified by 2030. Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, Hyundai, Fiat Chrysler, Honda and other automakers are making similar pledges. In preparation for this onslaught of new models, franchise car dealers in the U.S. \u2014 many of them longtime small businesses located in suburban and rural communities \u2014 are gearing up. Salespeople are getting ready to put you in an EV today. And because EVs have fewer moving parts, service technicians are being trained to maintain them. \"EVs are the big issue right now,\" said Mark Paladino, general manager of Colonial Ford in Danbury, Connecticut, and a 40-year veteran in the business. He was still excited about Ford's debut of the F-150 Lightning pickup, an all-electric version of the best-selling vehicle line in the nation for four decades running. Paladino's excitement is warranted, considering that Ford.com tallied 70,000 reservations for the Lightning within the first week of its official release on May 19, with $100 deposits plunked down for each, said Jason Mase, Ford's cross vehicle marketing manager. That followed the successful introduction of Ford's Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle, where 70% of initial customers were new to Ford. For the F-150 Lightning, Mase said, \"90% ordered the highest trim level and 80% ordered the extended-range battery. ... It was beyond our expectations.\" Colonial is one of 2,300 Ford dealers, among a total of roughly 3,000, that have volunteered to become EV-certified, an investment that entails training sales and service personnel, upgrading battery-charging stations and purchasing special equipment, parts and tools. The remaining third have thus far opted out of spending nearly $50,000 for the certification. Other manufacturers are asking for upwards of $300,000 for the designation.\u00a0 \"We were all in right away,\" Paladino said, adding that the family-owned dealership was previously trained on several gas-electric hybrid models, as well as Ford's first-ever EV, the 2021 Mustang Mach-E SUV, introduced in December. \"We see EVs as a part of our business that will only get larger, and we want to be in that world.\" EVs comprise less than 3% of overall new-car sales in the U.S. \u00a0Tesla has dominated the market, making up about about 55% of it, according to Credit Suisse \u2014 though that's down from 72% a few months ago, reflecting the growth in competition. Although EVs now represent only a fraction of the U.S. automotive fleet, they \"are eventually going to become a significant part of a car retailer's business,\" said Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail for market research firm J.D. Power. EV stocks are 'overpriced' \u2014 but there's a good way to play them, says strategist BofA picks 3 auto stocks to buy as 'car wars' heat up Citi upgrades Nio, says growing EV demand in China can lift stock more than 50% EV stocks are 'overpriced' \u2014 but there's a good way to play them, says strategist BofA picks 3 auto stocks to buy as 'car wars' heat up Citi upgrades Nio, says growing EV demand in China can lift stock more than 50% A Bloomberg New Energy Finance report estimated that by 2040, EVs will account for 58% of worldwide passenger vehicle sales, with China, Europe and the U.S., respectively, leading the pack.\u00a0 \"By providing their sales and service expertise, and as an education resource for customers, they add value to automakers,\" Sutton said of dealerships. Though he added that because EV sales to date have been concentrated in coastal states, Michigan and Texas, many dealers elsewhere remain in wait-and-see mode. In addition to manufacturers' ambitious targets, the Biden administration has proposed spending nearly $42 billion to build out the nation's EV battery-charging infrastructure, gas prices have inched up and ExxonMobil's shareholders elected three climate-friendly directors supported by an activist investing group to its board. Support for Biden's infrastructure spending plan, however, to which EV infrastructure spending is tied, remains uncertain. Car dealers are focused on the here and now. They should be heartened, then, by a Cars.com survey that reveals two-thirds of Americans are interested in buying an EV, despite barriers such as higher sticker prices than internal combustion engine (ICE) models and the paucity of charging stations. Plus, some EVs still qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit, while states such as California, New Jersey and New York offer additional rebates up to $5,000. These data help explain why the 17,000 members of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) \"can't wait for EV products to get here,\" said NADA President and CEO Mike Stanton. \"Dealers are in the business of selling cars and making customers happy, so why wouldn't they want to sell EVs?\" he said, dismissing reports of lackluster enthusiasm among dealers. Political support for climate change policies vary across the nation, and in the past year support has been dropping among Republicans for the federal government making action on clean energy a top priority, according to a recent survey conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason Center for Climate Change Communication. But considerable support remains among conservatives for providing tax rebates to people who purchase energy-efficient vehicles or solar panels: 78% of moderate Republicans and 60% of conservative Republicans. It was the only \"climate-friendly energy policy\" in the survey which a majority of both moderate Republican and conservative Republican registered voters support. One genuine concern for dealers, however, is the fact that EVs don't require oil changes, transmission repairs and other service owners of ICE vehicles routinely bear \u2014 and that account for 50% of dealers' gross profits. A 2019 report from AlixPartners estimates that dealers could see $1,300 less revenue in service and parts over the life of each EV they sell. Even though 70% of aftermarket service of ICE vehicles is handled by independent shops, franchise dealers don't want to cede EVs to them, especially as consumers familiarize themselves with battery charging and other peculiarities. \"The EV owner might trust the dealers more to perform service than the aftermarket shops earlier in their ownership period,\" Sutton said. The service element doesn't necessarily worry Rita Case, CEO of Rick Case Automotive Group in Ft. Lauderdale, which represents VW, Hyundai, Honda, Audi, Mazda and other brands at its dealerships in south Florida and Atlanta. \"EVs need tires, brakes, batteries, lights and some steering and drivetrain maintenance,\" she stated. Rick Case Auto is already selling and servicing a limited number of EVs and hybrids, but \"within the last six months we've ramped up EV training for our salespeople and technicians and purchased new charging equipment\" in anticipation of increased consumer demand for new electric models, Case said. GM has been readying its 4,100 franchise dealers over the past year, not only for the refreshed Chevrolet Bolt \u2014 an early EV entrant that has gone through a recent design \u2014 but also the upcoming electric GMC Hummer and the Cadillac Lyriq. \"Service is critical to what our dealers do today and will be in the future,\" said Travis Hester, GM's chief electric vehicle officer. \"EV service will definitely evolve and won't be exactly the same\" compared to that for ICE vehicles, he said, noting that some EV parts may last 10 to 15 years. \"No one is panicking about it, but we know it's going to change over time, so we're working with our dealers on that.\" Meanwhile, Paladino can't keep up with Colonial Ford's conventional service demands. \"We're booking and servicing every vehicle we can,\" he said. \"Right now, I'm three weeks out in servicing your car.\" Another issue on dealers' minds is direct-to-consumer (D2C) sales, the business model that's fueled Tesla's marketing of more than 385,000 EVs on U.S. roads to date. Tesla does operate about 130 company-owned showrooms, yet sales are transacted online. At last count, 33 states allowed D2C auto sales, with others' legislatures debating bills that would bypass the so-called franchise system that has legally connected dealers and manufacturers for more than a century. NADA, states' dealer groups and traditional automakers have advocated maintaining the franchise system, claiming that it levels the playing field. Then again, online marketing is nothing new to car manufacturers and dealers. Every brand maintains a website where shoppers can peruse models and pricing, and even custom design a new car. But they're ultimately referred to a local dealer, who completes the transaction and aims to establish a loyal relationship that includes routine maintenance, service and perhaps a future sale. Generating foot traffic \u2014 the proverbial \"kicking the tires\" routine \u2014 is the lifeblood of dealers' business models, so to survive they will have to adjust to consumers' appetite for buying directly online, a routine that only expanded during the pandemic. That means letting manufacturers take reservations and deposits online, as Ford and other manufacturers are doing, and finding ways to attract and foster long-term relationships with a new generation of EV drivers, such as special test-drive events, on-site charging and mobile service techs who make house calls. \"The dealer network has been around for a long time because they are able to pivot to where the market is and what customers expect and require,\" Sutton said. The auto industry is at an inflection point in the transition to EVs, and dealers large and small will have to pivot once again. \"If you're going to play in the EV sector, you've got embrace it now \u2014 the charging infrastructure, the parts, the equipment, the labor,\" Paladino said. While Case is waiting for greater demand for EVs, she's \"super positive\" about the future. \"I'm in the business of selling cars, and one thing I know for sure is people are going to want cars.\" "}, {"source": "CNBC", "title": "Billionaire Tim Draper is still bullish that bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2022 ", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/billionaire-tim-draper-still-predicts-bitcoin-will-reach-250000-.html", "date": "Mon, 14 Jun 2021 20:13:13 GMT", "content": "Billionaire venture capitalist and bitcoin investor Tim Draper is sticking by his prediction that bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2022 or early 2023 despite the cryptocurrency's wild swings in value and the turmoil around its environmentally unfriendly energy usage. \"I think I'm going to be right on this one,\" Draper tells CNBC Make It. Draper first made the bold price prediction back in 2018, at which time bitcoin was trading around $8,000, according to Coinbase. \"I'm either going to be really right or really wrong [but] I'm pretty sure that it's going in that direction,\" Draper says. That's because Draper believes the currency is going to be \"much more in use by then.\" \"Give it about a year and a half and retailers will all be on Opennode [a bitcoin payment processor], so everybody will accept bitcoin,\" Draper predicts. Currently only a few major companies accept bitcoin directly or indirectly through a third-party digital wallet app, including Microsoft, PayPal, Overstock, Whole Foods, Starbucks and Home Depot. And many experts see bitcoin as a store of value, like gold, rather than a currency. \"Then beyond that, I think [bitcoin] continues up because there are only 21 million of them,\" says Draper. By virtue of its code, only 21 million bitcoin can be \"mined.\" So far, more than 18 million bitcoin are already in circulation. Draper, 63, who built his fortune by making early investments in Twitter, Skype,\u00a0Tesla\u00a0and SpaceX (to name a few),\u00a0wouldn't share how much bitcoin he holds or whether he has invested in other cryptocurrencies. \"There must be something to dogecoin because it makes us all smile but no engineers are working on it,\" Drapers says. (Though, Elon Musk tweeted in May he was working with \"Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.\") \"I tend to focus on the ones where people are dedicating their lives to improving the currency,\" Draper adds. Draper says most engineers are working on improving bitcoin right now. Last week, bitcoin got its first upgrade in four years, called Taproot. Due to take effect in November, the change will reportedly mean greater transaction privacy and efficiency. It is also meant to unlock the potential for smart contracts on the bitcoin blockchain, CNBC reported. Bitcoin \"is sort of like Microsoft [in] the software world or Amazon in the e-commerce world,\" Draper says. He believes bitcoin will be the center of all financial activity for the next two to three decades. However, bitcoin's value is volatile, and there are concerns over its enormous energy usage. For this and other reasons, experts recommend only investing as much money in bitcoin as you can afford to lose. Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off of the cryptocurrency after Elon Musk tweeted in May that he was suspending bitcoin purchases at Tesla over environmental concerns. \"Elon, first of all, is one of the most brilliant men in the world...maybe the most brilliant, [but] he got this one wrong,\" Draper said last week. (A Tesla spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.) Draper points out that big banks have their own environmental issues. On Sunday, Musk tweeted that Tesla would accept bitcoin again when at least half of it can be mined using clean energy. Bitcoin rose more than 7%, nearing $40,000 on Monday, according to Coinbase. In April, it hit an all-time high of $64,829 before hitting a low of $30,000 in May following a 30% intraday crash, according to CNBC. It's not the first time, Draper has predicted the rise of the price of bitcoin. In 2014, when bitcoin was trading at around $500, he said bitcoin would top $10,000 within three years. In December 2017, bitcoin reached over $10,000, ballooning to a high of more than $18,900 that Dec. 19 before sliding back down to a low of $7,270 in early 2018, according to Coindesk. In 2014, Draper purchased nearly 30,000 bitcoins seized by the U.S. Marshals Services from the now-defunct online black market Silk Road.

New energy vehicles refer to battery-powered and hybrid cars. The category accounted for more than 10% of new car sales in China in March, and grew to 11.4% in May, said Wang Chuanfu, founder of BYD. He forecast that the penetration rate would surge to more than 70% in 2030. That's according to a transcript the company provided of his remarks at the China Auto Chongqing Summit held June 12 and 13. William Li, founder and CEO of electric car start-up Nio, was more optimistic. He predicted that so-called smart electric cars would account for 90% of new car sales in 2030, according to Chinese media reports. Nio did not have anything to add when contacted by CNBC. The U.S.-listed automaker leads its start-up peers in terms of monthly deliveries. But Nio's deliveries of 6,711 cars in May fell from 7,102 in April, remaining well below that of BYD. In May, BYD said its new energy passenger car sales rose 23% from the prior month to 31,681 vehicles, of which just over half \u2014 or 18,711 \u2014 were powered only by batteries. The company's Han sedan ranks among the five best-selling new energy vehicles sold in China \u2014 just behind Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y for the first five months of the year, according to the China Passenger Car Association. In first place is a budget electric car, the Wuling Hongguang Mini, developed under a General Motors' joint venture in China. Many foreign automakers such as Volkswagen have looked to launch electric cars in China first, where sales of battery-powered vehicles have gotten a boost from central government subsidies and other preferential policies. Beijing would like 20% of new cars sold to be new energy vehicles by 2025. As the local new energy vehicle market grows, BYD's Wang said he expects Chinese car brands will be able to account for 60% by 2030, thanks partly to their grasp of core technology.

One interesting aspect is that other cryptocurrencies have come up with solutions to address some of bitcoin's flaws, said Prasad, who was formerly head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. Bitcoin mining refers to the energy-intensive process required to produce new coins and ensure the payment network is secure and verified. The electricity used when transactions are validated on the bitcoin blockchain, as well as the mining process, is \"certainly not good for the environment,\" Prasad said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last month that his electric car company will stop accepting bitcoin as a form of payment because of environmental concerns, causing the price of bitcoin to drop 5% in a matter of minutes. He has since made an about-turn and said in a tweet on Sunday that Tesla will accept bitcoin in transactions if it can confirm \"reasonable\" and \"clean energy usage by miners.\" Crypto miners use purpose-built computers to solve complex mathematical equations that effectively enable a coin transaction to go through. The miners are rewarded for their efforts by being paid in the cryptocurrency.

The FBI said its agents were able to identify a virtual currency wallet that the hackers used to collect payment from Colonial Pipeline. \"The main idea of bitcoin\u2026 was to provide pseudonymity,\" said Prasad. \"But it turns out that if you use bitcoin a lot, and especially if you use Bitcoin to get any real goods and services, then it becomes possible eventually to link your address or your physical identity to your digital identity.\" What's interesting, he said, is that there are other cryptocurrencies trying to fix this and offer more anonymity. He highlighted Monero and Zcash as some examples. \"So bitcoin really has set off something of a search for a better alternative and people seem to be on the lookout for a medium of exchange that does not require them to go through a trusted institution like the government or a commercial bank \u2014 but it's not quite there yet,\" Prasad said. In theory, bitcoin was supposed to provide an anonymous and efficient medium of exchange but \"it hasn't worked in that respect,\" said the economics professor. Rather, it's \"slow and cumbersome\" to use bitcoin to pay for goods and services, and the market is very volatile, Prasad said. Bitcoin is prone to wide swings in volatility, as seen by its 30% plunge in a single day last month. \"So you could take a bitcoin to a store and one day, get a cup of coffee and another day, with the same bitcoin, be able to treat yourself to a lavish meal. So that doesn't work well for the medium of exchange,\" he said. Bitcoin has become a speculative asset for people who hope it will appreciate in value, rather than because they want to use it as a payment mode, Prasad said. \u2014 CNBC's Sam Shead contributed to this report.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak to the press after the central bank issues its statement Wednesday. Traders will be parsing his comments for any clues as to when the Fed could start to end its aggressive monthly asset purchases, especially given recent hotter-than-expected inflation readings. Billionaire hedge fund manager\u00a0Paul Tudor Jones\u00a0said this week's Fed meeting could be the most important in Powell's career, and he warned that the chairman could spark a big sell-off in risk assets if he doesn't do a good job of signaling a taper. \"If they course correct, if they say, 'We've got incoming data, we've accomplished our mission or we're on the way very rapidly to accomplishing our mission on employment,' then you're going to get a taper tantrum,\" Tudor Jones said. \"You're going to get a sell-off in fixed income.

It also said it is raising its earnings guidance for the first half of the year. The additional money will be used to\u00a0expand its rollout of EVs and accelerate production of its battery and fuel cell technologies, including two new U.S. battery plants in addition to two under construction, by 2025. America's largest automaker is racing to catch up to EV leader Tesla and compete for a leadership position against other well-established automakers such as Volkswagen. GM plans to sell more than 1 million EVs annually by 2025. \"There are several growth engines in General Motors, and we're going to just keep pushing ahead and accelerating them like we're doing today of announcing a faster pivot to EVs,\" CEO Mary Barra said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"I really see long-term value creation for General Motors and for our shareholders.\" GM's plans to expand its electric and autonomous vehicle lineup and technology have been praised by Wall Street. Its stock has almost tripled since reaching a 12-month low of $23.33 last July.  Shares were up by as much as 3.8% during intraday trading Wednesday to $63.09 a share. The stock closed Wednesday at $61.76 a share, up 1.6%. GM said the new investments are enabled by its strong underlying business, including record pretax earnings over the last three quarters and strong demand for its upcoming EVs. \"Across the board, we are seeing exceptionally strong reactions and positive response to all of our electric vehicles,\" Barra said. CFO Paul Jacobson said GM projects better-than-expected results in the second quarter despite a global semiconductor chip shortage that's impacting the industry. He said GM expects adjusted pretax earnings of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion during the first half of the year, up from an estimated $5.5 billion. For the year, GM previously said it expected pretax profits \"at the higher end\" of a $10 billion to $11 billion range.\u00a0It didn't provide an update on its full-year earnings. \"We remain cautious about the full year, and we'll have more information about the full-year guidance on our earnings call on Aug. 4,\" Jacobson told reporters during a call Wednesday. GM's increased spending plans come less than a month after crosstown rival Ford Motor increased its EV spending to more than $30 billion by 2025. But Ford's investments date to 2016, while GM's are for 2020 through 2025. Before the coronavirus pandemic shut down auto factories in March 2020, GM initially said it would invest $20 billion in autonomous and electric vehicles through 2025. It increased that spending to $27 billion in November as it pulled ahead vehicle programs and accelerated battery cell production. GM's previously said it would roll out 30 new EVs by 2025. The company said Wednesday it will add to those plans, but it declined to provide more details. \"We feel good about all of our projects that are going on,\" Jacobson said. \"We're moving aggressively and there's a lot a lot of exciting things ahead for us.\" GM's new investments were announced ahead of Barra's meeting Wednesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats to discuss EVs and vehicle emissions, according to Reuters, which first reported on the automaker's plans late Tuesday. A GM spokesman confirmed Barra is in Washington but declined to comment on specific meetings. Barra told CNBC the company is continuing to have discussions about incentives and other regulatory matters regarding EVs. Buyers of EVs from GM as well as Tesla are no longer eligible for an up to $7,500 federal tax credit after the companies sold 200,000 of the vehicles. GM has been lobbying to have such incentives reinstated. \"We really think being a first mover shouldn't be something that's penalized as we look at EV adoption,\" Barra said. \"We continue to have those discussions. I am optimistic that there's going to be a legislative solution here, and we're going to continue to support those changes.\" "}, {"source": "CNBC", "title": "Suze Orman likes bitcoin.

Ford announced last month it would accelerate the rollout of EVs under a new restructuring plan, called \"Ford+,\" led by CEO Jim Farley. The plan aims to bring in 40% of Ford's global sales volume via EVs by 2030.\u00a0 \"Lincoln will usher in a new era of electrified vehicles and connected experiences globally, and we plan to deliver a full portfolio of electrified Lincoln vehicles globally by the end of the decade,\" Lincoln President Joy Falotico said during a media briefing. Lincoln's EV targets fall short of its largest American rival, Cadillac. The General Motors luxury brand has plans to offer only EVs by 2030. Neither Lincoln nor Cadillac offer a fully electric vehicle in their current lineups as they attempt to catch up to EV leader Tesla. Cadillac's plans are part of a larger \"aspiration\" by GM to\u00a0exclusively sell\u00a0EVs by 2035. Falotico said Lincoln will continue to offer plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as well as gas vehicles as the brand transitions to EVs. She declined to set a timeline for Lincoln to reach a 100% electric lineup, saying it will depend on customer demand, specifically in its largest markets of North America and China. \"We're going all-in to be a fully electric brand, but we'll do it as the customers adopt,\" she told CNBC. Lincoln said it will debut a new EV for China and North America next year as the brand celebrates its 100th anniversary. It will join the plug-in hybrid Aviator and Corsair SUVs. Lincoln said its plans to launch four new EVs, but it did not disclose a specific timeframe for those vehicles. Falotico also declined to specify whether Lincoln's new EVs will share names with their current four vehicles, including the well-known Navigator SUV.

El Salvador passed a new law to adopt bitcoin as legal tender on Wednesday, becoming the first country to do so. This allows bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, to be used as payment for goods and taxes. Businesses can price their goods in bitcoin, and exchanges will not be subject to capital gains tax, CNBC reported. Following the news, bitcoin's price jumped 6% to over $37,000 on Thursday. During the Senate banking\u00a0committee hearing on central bank digital currencies on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called for cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. \"Cryptocurrency has created opportunities to scam investors, assist criminals and worsen the climate crisis,\" she said. \"The threats posted by crypto show that Congress and federal regulators can't continue to hide out, hoping that crypto will go away. It won't. It's time to confront these issues head on.\" However, Warren had a different outlook on the possibility of a digital dollar backed by the Federal Reserve. \"Digital currency from central banks has great promise,\" she said. \"But in order for those advantages to be realized, the digital version needs to be secure, stable and accepted everywhere.\" Several attendees of the Bitcoin 2021 Conference in Miami on June 4-5 tested positive for Covid-19. There was no mask mandate and no proof-of-vaccination requirement to attend. On Friday, the Miami mayor's office told CNBC that the speculation about attendees contracting Covid-19 at the conference was unconfirmed: \"We have no reason to believe the conference was a 'Super Spreader,'\" the office said in a statement. \"At this point, with the information we know, this characterization of the event is not only unfair, but also irresponsible.\" A rare CryptoPunk sold on Thursday at Sotheby's for\u00a0over $11.7 million. The seven-figure sale set \"a new world auction record for a single CryptoPunk,\" according to Sotheby's. Dubbed \"Covid Alien,\" CryptoPunk 7523 is\u00a0an NFT, or nonfungible token, collectible. It is one of nine \"alien punks\" in the entire series and is the only one with a mask. The buyer, Sotheby's told CNBC Make It, was billionaire Shalom Meckenzie, the largest shareholder of DraftKings. Taproot, the first bitcoin upgrade in four years, was approved on Saturday. It will take effect in November, and it will better the blockchain in a number of ways. First, it will increase transaction privacy and efficiency. In addition, the upgrade will allow for smart contracts, which can power applications like DeFi, or decentralized finance, which is already a key part of the ethereum blockchain. \"The most important thing for Taproot is ... smart contracts,\" Fred Thiel, CEO of cryptocurrency mining specialist Marathon Digital Holdings, recently told CNBC. \"Smart contracts essentially give you the opportunity to really build applications and businesses on the blockchain.\" On Sunday, Tesla\u00a0CEO Elon Musk said the company will resume accepting bitcoin as payment \"when [there's] confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend,\" he tweeted. Afterward, the price of bitcoin jumped to about $40,000 on Monday.

Approximately 160,000 40-foot containers, the equivalent of 300,000 TEUs, or 20-foot equivalent units, are waiting to be exported, according to logistics companies with operating knowledge of the port. The port was partially shut down from May 25-27 after five crew members aboard a container ship docked at the port tested positive for Covid. Additional positive cases among port workers and in the surrounding area had carriers such as Maersk characterizing the situation in its customer alerts as deteriorating. The port terminal serves 100 ships every week and is a pivotal export location for both the United States and Europe. In 2020, the Port of Yantian processed 13.3 million containers. But operations were still stalled as of last week with few ships seen docking at the port in satellite photos provided to CNBC by Planet Labs. SEKO Logistics, which has operations in Asia, said the port is slowly reopening but the container congestion will take a while to unwind. \"Port operations are getting better and assumed to be closer to 50% to 60% percent productivity,\" said Akhil Nair, VP Global Carrier Management & Ocean Strategy at SEKO Logistics-Hong Kong, said in an email. \"However, there is a long waiting list of ships that must perform both discharge and load operations. It will take a while. If all the extra containers are forty feet in length, you are looking at roughly 160,000 physical containers that need to be exported.\" Mirko Woitzik, senior manager of EMEA for Intelligence Solutions at Everstream Analytics, which also has ground logistics in the area, told CNBC his firm sees the same amount of containers waiting to be loaded onto vessels. \"There are not a lot of vessels calling Yantian now,\" Woitzik said. \"While you do have the occasional vessels calling to the port, it depends on how long they stay and if they pick up the export.\" He said they could just be dropping off the imports. \"The port productivity is increasing but will take time to work through. This just adds to the days vessels have to wait to get into port,\" he said. Over 90% of the world's electronics are exported out of the Port of Yantian. According to FreightWaves SONAR data, the largest-named consignee for the port is TV maker TTE Technologies.\u00a0Other major exporters include Tesla, Williams-Sonoma, QVC, JoAnn Fabrics, Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon, Ikea, Walgreens and Hasbro. Some industry experts are already warning this delay could impact shipments for the December holidays, Woitzik said. \"This is really what's on everyone's mind,\" he said. \"The carriers are canceling most of the port calls to Yantian until at least the middle of July.\" That means a lot of exports won't leave the Chinese port until then, he said. While some exporters may move their goods to other ports, not all will follow suit, Woitzik said. Peak holiday shipping season starts in August, he said. \"That's when companies start to ship their products to get them on the shelves in time for the holidays,\" he said. \"This backlog only adds to the volumes of containers waiting in line to be transported.\" The delays at Yantian would likely hold up exports of electronic consumer goods, electrical machinery, household appliances, medical equipment, auto parts and furniture, Woitzik said. \"These products have thinner margins and are likely to get delayed,\" he said. \"Walmart and Home Depot can be impacted and see shortages because they have logistics bases around that port. Basically, the shipping lines are taking the highest-bidding shippers. Usually, those bidders are the high-value electronic consumer goods.\" Earlier this week, Home Depot's President and Chief Operating Officer Ted Decker told CNBC the company has chartered its own vessel to start transporting products in mid-July in an effort to avoid maritime congestion that might hold up goods needed in time for the holidays. Both the U.S. West Coast and the Chinese ports have seen record container volumes during the pandemic. The latest slowdown at Yantian and the diversion of vessels away from there to the ports of Hong Kong, Shekou and Nansha have created more congestion. Covid infections have also been reported at the Guangzhou port terminal of Nansha and in Shenzhen port. The combination of resurging Covid outbreaks and the additional container surges are slowing down the movement of containers at the Port of Nansha. \"The ripple effects of this slowdown in Yantian will be felt in about four weeks' time in the United States,\" Woitzik said. \"Depending on how quickly the West Coast ports can clear the current vessel backlog, the congestion will only get even worse when the Yantian exports start arriving.\" "}, {"source": "CNBC", "title": "Kim Kardashian West and other influencers are being paid to advertise cryptocurrency on social media ", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/kim-kardashian-west-charli-damelio-jake-paul-posting-paid-crypto-ads.html", "date": "Tue, 15 Jun 2021 18:44:43 GMT", "content": "As cryptocurrency has become more mainstream this year, it has reached the influencer world. Influencers, such as the D'Amelio family and Tana Mongeau, have started to post paid advertisements on their social media platforms for different digital coins and exchanges. Even Kim Kardashian West posted an ad for ethereummax on her Instagram story on Sunday to her 228 million followers. Followed by a short clip of her speaking to her camera about ethereummax with \"#ad\" written at the bottom of the screen, Kardashian West posted text: \"Are you guys into crypto???\" \"This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends told me about the ethereum max token!\" the post read. She again added different hashtags, including #ad, which is required to reveal that her post is paid for, along with #emax and #disrupthistory. Other celebrities, including Floyd Mayweather, have endorsed ethereummax as well. Mayweather brought up the altcoin during the Bitcoin 2021 Conference earlier this month and was, in turn, booed off stage. Ethereummax was also\u00a0accepted as payment for tickets to\u00a0Mayweather's\u00a0recent fight\u00a0with YouTuber Logan Paul. Ethereummax is an altcoin that redistributes a small percentage of transactions to its token holders. It launched in May with a total supply of 2 quadrillion. However, despite its star-studded partnerships, ethereummax is viewed as a more risky cryptocurrency to some in the crypto world. As Decrypt points out, it's \"mostly just a marketing campaign.\"\u2060 Ethereummax doesn't have a white paper as other crypto projects do, and only a few details about its developers are known. (The ethereummax team did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.) Though it's unknown how much Kardashian West was paid for the advertisement, a 2019 court filing revealed that she can reportedly earn between $300,000 and $500,000 for a single Instagram post. For long-term social media deals, she can sometimes earn millions of dollars. (Kardashian West did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.) Gen Z and young millennial influencers \u2014 many of which primarily have young followers \u2014 have posted paid ads for cryptocurrencies and exchanges recently as well. The family account of TikTok stars Charli, 17, and Dixie D'Amelio, 19, posted their partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini on Instagram in May, Insider reported. \"We are learning more about cryptocurrency as a family, thank you @gemini for Charli's birthday gift. #GeminiPartner,\" the post read, though Gemini has an age requirement of 18 or older. The family's account has over 934,000 followers on Instagram, but Charli and Dixie have even larger followings themselves. Charli has over 117 million followers on TikTok and over 42 million on Instagram. Dixie has over 52 million followers on TikTok and over 24 million on Instagram. \"We believe it's important to provide financial literacy and access to educational resources about cryptocurrency through various channels,\" a spokesperson for Gemini tells CNBC Make It. \"Gemini also works with influencers ... to help educate their followers about cryptocurrencies and raise awareness about the Gemini brand.\" Along with the D'Amelio family, YouTubers like Paul and Loren Gray have posted endorsements for different cryptocurrencies and exchanges to their millions of followers. Even Matt James, known as the first Black male lead on ABC's \"The Bachelor,\" has posted on his social media about his partnership with crypto financial services company BlockFi. Though all cryptocurrency is considered to be a risky, volatile investment, the altcoins being pushed out by these influencers, like ethereummax, require even more caution, experts warn. Especially when advertised to younger audiences. This kind of endorsement can be extra problematic when it isn't made clear that the influencer has been paid to post, James Ledbetter, editor of fintech newsletter FIN and\u00a0CNBC\u00a0contributor\u200b, tells CNBC Make It. \"As with many other products and services these days, a cryptocurrency or exchange paying social media influencers can be an effective way to get the word out,\" he says. However, \"I'd be concerned that at least some of that audience is both financially unsophisticated and has limited access to funds, which is why this has for years been an area of regulatory action.\" Investors should always do their own research before deciding where to put their money. As the SEC warned in 2017, \"it is never a good idea\u00a0to make an investment decision just because someone famous says\u00a0a product or service\u00a0is a good investment.\" \"These types of arrangements could potentially harm investors, as well as attract regulatory scrutiny for the crypto companies,\" Ledbetter says. But after seeing the effect that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's tweets have had on cryptocurrencies and stocks, it shouldn't be surprising that companies in the space are trying to find more players to do the same, Ledbetter says. \"Through crypto-memes and Elon Musk, my sense is that a good portion of [young investors have] already been exposed to cryptocurrency,\" Ledbetter says. \"But it's conceivable that influencers might accelerate that trend.\" Correction: This story has been updated to show that ethereummax was accepted as payment for tickets to Floyd Mayweather's recent fight against Logan Paul.

Attendees of the annual Founders Forum event on Thursday included the former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron (who lives just up the road), ex-Finance Minister George Osborne, and the past and present U.K. tech ministers: Ed Vaizey and Oliver Dowden, respectively. Google's Matt Brittin and Salesforce's Zahra Bahrololoumi, the European bosses of the Silicon Valley heavyweights, showed up, as did the general manager for TikTok in Europe, Rich Waterworth, who previously ran marketing for YouTube on the continent.\u00a0 Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Zoom co-founder Eric Yuan beamed themselves in from the U.S. for video interviews, while DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman resurfaced after he exited the company in controversial circumstances to join Google. Mike Lynch, who is fighting extradition to the U.S. on fraud claims after selling his software start-up Autonomy to HP for over $11 billion, was also in attendance. Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp was due to attend but had to drop out after the U.K. pushed back the date for its full lockdown easing. \"Everyone I want to meet in Europe is here,\" reads a quote from Schmidt on the event's website. \"Founders Forum has emerged as the go-to destination for tech in Europe.\" The founders and CEOs of apps like Monzo, Wise (formerly TransferWise), Citymapper, and many more also turned up to network and listen to talks on everything from existential risks that threaten to wipe humanity off the face of the Earth to hiring top talent in artificial intelligence. Elsewhere, venture capitalists from firms with billions of dollars at their disposal \u2014 such as Sequoia, Index Ventures, Atomico and Balderton \u2014 were also present, as were some of the U.K.'s most active angel investors. For many, it was the first in-person tech event they've been able to attend in over a year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Throughout the day, people kept saying how \"weird\" it was to be there as they fist-bumped and elbow-bumped one another. Everyone had to record themselves taking a Covid-19 test and getting a negative result in an app developed by Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus before they were allowed to attend. Branded as \"something like the Davos of tech\" by The Guardian newspaper, Founders Forum is put on by serial entrepreneur and investor Brent Hoberman. The former Eton and Oxford student, who co-founded Lastminute.com and the recently listed Made.com, is well-known for having one of the most impressive networks in the European tech scene. Many of his friends and investors are invited to Founders Forum each year. The organizers describe it as a private network of the world's top-tier entrepreneurs, CEOs and investors from technology, media and digital. Previous guests have included Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, former Apple design boss Jony Ive, broadcaster David Attenborough, and former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. Prince William, a member of the British royal family, has also attended.\u00a0 Normally held at the five-star Grove Hotel, this year marks the first time Founders Forum has been held at Soho Farmhouse. Aston Martins, Maseratis, Range Rovers and Teslas could all be spotted in the car park on the day of the event.\u00a0 \"To have an event there is crazy money,\" a member of Soho House, which owns Soho Farmhouse, told CNBC, asking to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the discussion. For some, one of the highlights of the day was witnessing British jet suit inventor Richard Browning flying around a few feet above the ground. After being fed throughout the day, guests were treated to grilled lobster and strawberries and cream in the evening. On their way home, they were given goodie bags containing products from the likes of Cowshed and Charlotte Tilbury. Timothy Armoo, CEO of Fanbytes, a company that helps brands advertise through social video, told CNBC he enjoyed the event. \"The quality of the conversations remained very high which was quite pleasing,\" he said. \"With this being the first major event that people have been to in a while, there is the danger that it becomes more of a 'catch up' session for friends, but that wasn't the case at all. Meaningful connections were fostered, and that's what you're looking for when you go to these events. I also really admired how they handled social-distancing rules. People were respectful, and the pre-process of taking tests was quite comforting.\" Correction: This report was updated to delete an incorrect reference that Facebook's Nicola Mendelsohn was in attendance.

The 6.6% surge was the biggest 12-month rise in the final demand index since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking the data in November 2010. On a monthly basis, the producer price index for final demand rose 0.8%, ahead of the Dow Jones estimate of 0.5%.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a list offering details about crashes under review by its Special Crash Investigations programs. The agency had already confirmed some specific Tesla crash investigations but had not previously released to Reuters a full accounting of all Tesla crashes investigated where Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system was suspected of being involved. Of the 30 Tesla crashes, NHTSA has ruled out Tesla\u2019s Autopilot in three and published reports on two of the crashes. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters first sought a full list from NHTSA more than a year ago under a public records request. The list only includes the state and month the crashes occurred. Previously, NHTSA said it had opened 28 special crash investigations into Tesla crashes, with 24 pending. The spreadsheet shows a February 2019 crash where Autopilot use was undetermined. Autopilot, which handles some driving tasks, was operating in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has said. The NTSB has criticized Tesla\u2019s lack of system safeguards for Autopilot, which allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods. The spreadsheet shows NHTSA has opened eight investigations into Tesla crashes since March. The issue has gotten new attention after a fiery April 17 Texas crash that killed two men in Texas in which police had said they believed no one was behind the wheel. The National Transportation Safety Board said in May that testing suggested the vehicle\u2019s automated steering system was \u201cnot available\u201d on the road where the accident occurred. On Wednesday, Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell cited Tesla crashes as the panel voted against moving ahead with regulations to speed the adoption of self-driving cars. \u201cIt seems like every other week we\u2019re hearing about a new vehicle that crashed when it was on Autopilot\u201d Cantwell said. Separately, NHTSA has conducted no new tests after it withdrew its designation last month that some newer Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles as having four advanced safety features after the automaker said it was removing radar sensors to transition to a camera-based Autopilot system. The agency said Thursday that after discussions with Tesla it restored the lane departure warning designation after Tesla confirmed the technology was unaffected. NHTSA said in a statement it has \u201cnot yet finalized the list of Model Year 2022 vehicles\u201d for testing. The spreadsheet also notes NHTSA has opened six other investigations into six other crashes involving driver assistance systems, including two involving Cadillac vehicles in which there were no reported injuries. The other four include two involved a 2012 Lexus RX450H and 2017 Navya Arma in which there were no reported injuries. The remaining two involved 2017 Volvo XC90 vehicles, including an Uber Technologies self-driving test vehicle that struck and killed a woman in Arizona in 2018. Uber made a series of development decisions that contributed to the crash\u2019s cause and deactivated the automatic emergency braking systems in the Volvo XC90 vehicle, safety investigators found.

Bitcoin has gyrated to Musk\u2019s views for months since Tesla announced a $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase in February and said it would take the cryptocurrency in payment. He later said the electric car maker would not accept bitcoin due to concerns over how mining the currency requires high energy use and contributes to climate change. \u201cWhen there\u2019s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions,\u201d Musk said on Twitter on Sunday. Bitcoin rallied more than 9% after that message, breaking above its 20-day moving average, and it climbed a tiny bit further in Asia to hit $39,838.92. \u201cThe market had been going through another round of correction over the weekend \u2026 until Elon Musk\u2019s tweet of accepting BTC again for Tesla purchases changed sentiment,\u201d said Bobby Ong, co-founder of crypto analytics website CoinGecko. He said the market was also supported by software company and major bitcoin-backer MicroStrategy raising half a billion dollars to buy bitcoin. Bitcoin is up about 33% this year but has collapsed from a record peak above $60,000 amid a regulatory crackdown in China and Musk\u2019s apparently wavering enthusiasm for it. Telsa stock is down about 30% since the company\u2019s bitcoin purchase. Musk\u2019s tweet was made in response to an article based on remarks from Magda Wierzycka, head of cybersecurity firm Syngia , who in a radio interview last week accused him of \u201cprice manipulation\u201d and selling a \u201cbig part\u201d of his exposure. \u201cThis is inaccurate,\u201d Musk said. \u201cTesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.\u201d Musk had tweeted in May that Tesla \u201cwill not be selling any bitcoin\u201d and \u201chas not sold any bitcoin,\u201d but investors are keenly awaiting Tesla\u2019s next earnings update \u2013 due next month \u2013 for any disclosure of changes to its position. Musk has taken issue with the vast computing power required to process bitcoin transactions and in early June posted messages appearing to lament a breakup with bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies were steady after weekend gains, with ether at $2,491 and one-time Musk darling dogecoin buying about 32 U.S. cents on crypto exchange Binance.

Registrations of the sporty SUV, which in China starts from around $53,000, rose to 12,785 in May from 5,520 in April, data from China Automotive Information Net show. Registrations of the cheaper Model 3 sedan were 9,324, up from 6,429. April\u2019s figures were well down on March because some production lines at the Shanghai factory were suspended for two weeks for maintenance and adjustment. Tesla only starting making deliveries of the Model Y in China in January. \u201cOnce the Model Y gets to full production, we\u2019ll probably see a ratio of almost a 2-to-1\u201d versus Model 3s, said Tu Le, the managing director of Beijing-based consultancy Sino Auto Insights. \u201cChinese consumers love SUVs and crossovers. I think the Model Y is going to do really well toward the end of this year.\u201d Data from China\u2019s Passenger Car Association released earlier this month also showed Tesla\u2019s China shipments rebounded in May, with the electric-car pioneer reporting wholesales of 33,463 locally made vehicles last month, compared with 25,845 in April. There\u2019s been some concern about how demand for Tesla cars may be impacted by a protest that went viral at the Shanghai auto show in mid-April and a spate of crashes that may have soured public opinion toward the California-based company. In another setback, some local governments and official institutions are reviewing Tesla ownership among their staff, citing concerns the cars pose security risks, Bloomberg reported last month. The EVs have also been banned from some military complexes and housing compounds because of concerns about data being collected by in-built cameras. Tesla has moved to reassure authorities, saying any data collected in China is stored locally. While Tesla\u2019s May wholesale figures may not necessarily reflect the level of retail demand Tesla fields directly, the Passenger Car Association is forecasting increased interest in larger, roomier cars. Last week it adjusted its outlook for total new-energy vehicle annual sales to 2.4 million cars from 2.2 million, noting China\u2019s policy to allow families to have three children should benefit the automobile market, particularly in the seven-seater category. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

The \u00c4ngelholm, Sweden-based company is experimenting with ultra-high-voltage battery packs and biofuels using emissions from\u00a0volcanoes to build\u00a0environmentally \u201cbenign\u201d and potentially even carbon-neutral cars, without sacrificing performance. Founded in 1994, Koenigsegg has slowly ramped up output of its vehicles to around 35 units a year. The company\u00a0sells to the super rich in search of cutting-edge technology, exclusivity\u00a0and hand-craftmanship using\u00a0the lightest\u00a0bespoke\u00a0materials. In the midst of a global pandemic, Koenigsegg\u2019s already-small\u00a0volume\u00a0was hampered, and the global\u00a0shortage of semiconductors has not helped. However, Koenigsegg\u00a0has big ambitions for a next phase: to double its factory footprint within two to three years and expand production capacity to thousands of cars a year. To achieve that, von Koenigsegg has turned to former Tesla executive Evan\u00a0Horetsky, who oversaw the construction of the electric-car maker\u2019s factories in Reno, Nevada,\u00a0and Shanghai. Von Koenigsegg has tasked Horetsky with dramatically changing the company\u2019s footprint and bringing its technology to a much greater volume of models and drivetrains. As chief industrialization officer, he\u2019s seeking\u00a0a site for a new factory to bring\u00a0Koenigsegg\u2019s history of vertical integration and investment in technology to a much broader audience. Here are excerpts from a discussion with von Koenigsegg and Horetsky, edited for length and clarity: Christian von Koenigsegg:\u00a0I started Koenigsegg in 1994 when I was 22 years old. I had a dream since I was a young boy to build my own car, preferably a sports car,\u00a0and I started my first company when I was 19;\u00a0that is the holding company within our group today. It took me eight years to go from dream to delivering the first record-beating production car in 2002, and since then we have done eight\u00a0different models and been growing all the time. Now, we\u2019re growing a little bit faster and have parallel models in production and different types of cars and different types of mobility projects in the pipeline, as well. Evan Horetsky:\u00a0I started my career with the U.S. Navy doing research integration. From there I had a bit of a gap where I\u00a0was part of a four-person startup building autonomous boats. Then I got the call from Tesla with the crazy idea to focus on the machine that builds the machine, or in other words, think of a factory as a product. That took\u00a0me to Reno, Nevada, where I helped design and build the gigafactory. I then went to Shanghai for about nine months. I most recently led the effort for Gigafactory Berlin. Now I\u2019m here with\u00a0Koenigsegg with the ambition alongside\u00a0Christian to scale up, diversify the product portfolio and\u00a0get deeper into different forms of future mobility and see what we can create. Q: Koenigsegg says it\u2019s propulsion agnostic. What do you mean by that? CVK: If we take a pure electric sports car, they tend to be quite heavy because you need a quite large battery to have enough range and performance. That goes against the sporty nature of the car. We electrify in a different way with more extreme cell technology for power output. And then we have extreme combustion-engine technology running on renewable fuels, but very good aftertreatment systems, and our free-valve technology\u00a0where we can really make sure we combust extremely efficiently with very small engines to make the car lighter, more exciting, have better performance, but still being environmentally benign. What we mean by agnostic is that we mix and match whatever makes the most sense at each given time and for each model. We\u2019re not\u00a0stuck in traditional combustion technology. The technology we develop there is really next-generation beyond anything else I\u2019ve seen out in the marketplace, and also next-generation electrification, and combining these technologies in an interesting way to make our product stand out and be as competitive as we can with as little environmental footprint as possible. You don\u2019t have to pollute the planet just because you want to have a fast, interesting sports car. What is the challenge in changing Koeniggseg and how it builds cars? EH: Koenigsegg has hasn\u2019t acted as much like the typical automotive manufacturers in that they also applied a lot of vertical integration to what they\u2019re doing. In-house composites, software and\u00a0hardware. This was similar at Tesla, too.\u00a0 With Koenigsegg, we\u2019re going to expand the in-house capabilities to more electrification platforms, to motors, batteries, inverters and maybe other electronics. We will also look at different ways we can impact the world with mobility solutions and a lot of those are going to have to be higher volume than the hypercar does right now. Why is Koenigsegg interested in volcanoes? CVK: It\u2019s a\u00a0very interesting way of creating an environmental benign propulsion\u00a0energy source. So there is this technology from Iceland, it was invented there, where they cap the CO2 emittance from semi-active volcanoes and convert that into methanol. And if you take that methanol and you power the plants that do the conversion of other fuels and then power the ship that transports the those fuels to Europe or the U.S. or Asia, wherever it goes, you put the fuel completely CO2-neutral into the vehicle. And of course with the correct aftertreatment systems, depending on the environment you\u2019re in, you can kind of clean up the particles in the atmosphere while you\u2019re using the engine. So you can be very much environmentally conscious doing that. It\u2019s just a fun aspect of renewable fuels that are not talked so much about, but there are many, many other technologies that are coming up. What do you hope to achieve from this point? EH: Within two or\u00a0three years, roughly,\u00a0we should have more than doubled our factory footprint. We should have designed capacity for the thousands of cars per year versus tens or hundreds, and we should have an ability to be highly flexible on our technological innovations within a production line. There\u2019s a bit of a diamond-in-the-rough here, with extreme technical maturity and technical talent\u00a0throughout Koenigsegg, that I think could do more in the world. The Tesla Model S Plaid\u00a0can do zero-to-60 in less than two seconds and it costs $130,000. Why should someone buy a $3 million supercar that uses these different technologies and fuel sources? CVK: That type of performance is becoming kind of a non-competitive aspect for our extreme megacars. It\u2019s an obvious thing to have, especially with all the electric cars coming out like Tesla. What you\u2019re getting when you\u2019re buying an extreme\u00a0hypercar or megacar from us or one of our competitors is something completely hand-built. It\u2019s a bespoke piece of art with performance that can\u00a0beat those cheaper electrical cars in a straight line.\u00a0But then you have to also realize they\u2019re 500 or 600 kilograms\u00a0lighter. So when you turn and when you break and when you drive around a race track, you still get a huge performance difference. It\u2019s more than performance. It\u2019s\u00a0the hand-built aspect, the bespoking, the unique surfacing, the unique materials to make it light. For sure,\u00a0there is a right to exist for these unique cars. They\u2019re works of art, really. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

Europe\u2019s largest automaker is in the midst of the most aggressive push into EVs by a traditional carmaker, with plans to launch about 70 battery-powered models by the end of the decade. Peers from Toyota Motor Corp. to Ford Motor Co. have followed suit in recent months, stepping up their challenge to Tesla Inc. On Wednesday, General Motors Co. raised planned investments in future technology for a second time in eight months to $35 billion. VW plans to churn out vehicles based on its dedicated electric-car platform at eight factories worldwide by 2022, with Europe and China accounting for the biggest chunk of production. So far the only model to be build in North America from next year is the ID.4 compact SUV at VW\u2019s sole U.S. factory in Chattanooga. The ID.4 spearheads the global rollout of VW-branded electric cars after last year\u2019s bumpy introduction of the ID.3 hatchback, which primarily targets European customers. VW is adding the ID.5 crossover later this year and the seven-seat ID.6 in China in the fall. Plans for a subcompact EV below the ID.3 priced at less than 25,000 euros have been pulled forward by two years to 2025. Andreas Krueger, VW\u2019s head of electric mobility, said the brand plans to make a mid-sized station wagon code-named AeroB in 2024 to broaden its lineup further. VW\u2019s electric-car architecture for mass-market vehicles will be improved for battery ranges of as much as 700 kilometers (453 miles) and faster charging, he said. This improvements will include so-called bidirectional charging, allowing the vehicle battery to service as power storage and feed energy back into the grid. Besides growing the ID. lineup, VW is working on a new car \u2014 code-named Trinity \u2014 to help narrow the gap to Tesla on software. Due to be launched in 2026, the vehicle will be made in a highly-automated factory that\u2019ll pit VW\u2019s biggest plant in Wolfsburg against Tesla\u2019s first European site under construction outside Berlin.

Bitcoin rose above $40,000 on Monday following tweets from Tesla boss Elon Musk, who said Tesla sold the currency but may resume transactions using it. It was last up 1.8% at $39,686. While bitcoin is currently trading 36% below its 11-year exponential trend, Dan Morehead, co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, said in his Blockchain Letter on Monday that investors should resist the urge to close positions and instead go the other way if they have the emotional and financial resources to do so. \u201cBitcoin generally goes way up\u2026Anyone that has held bitcoin for 3.25 years has made money,\u201d said Morehead.

Meanwhile, the race to catch up to Tesla is in full swing. Let\u2019s start with Tesla itself, which just this week announced the unexpected departure of Jerome Guillen, who served as president of heavy trucking and was one of four execs running the company with CEO Elon Musk. Guillen had been with Tesla for a decade, and had previously served as president of Tesla\u2019s automotive business. This might be welcome news for Apple, which has been revving up plans since 2014 to be a rival and added Ulrich Kranz, a former senior executive at BMW AG\u2019s electric car division and founder of Canoo Inc., a developer of self-driving vehicles. It all seems a bit like a race to the moon, no? And Canada isn\u2019t going to be left out in the cold either. Closer to home, Raquel Urtasun, a University of Toronto professor of computer science and world-leading expert in machine learning and computer vision, has left her position as chief scientist at Uber\u2019s ATG self-driving car lab in Toronto to start her own autonomous car company. The startup, called Waabi, will focus on using AI to address the challenges that plague the full commercialization of self-driving technology. Waabi\u00a0announced more than $100 million in funding this week \u2014 one of the largest rounds of initial financing secured by a Canadian startup. Mark her and Waabi as one to watch. Every day, another survey on hybrid work strategy. Which is great; we can\u2019t get enough and returning to the office is a contentious topic. This time, we get feedback from Gen Z. Some workers are all for it\u2014 in a recent poll by Angus Reid for ADP Canada, 36 per cent of the Canadian Gen Zers surveyed were all for the return to their desks \u2014 while others are dreading the post-pandemic shift back to the traditional nine-to-fives they left behind. It\u2019ll all come down to company policy, on an organization-by-organization basis, which may leave employees having to make some tough decisions. Every day, another survey on hybrid work strategy.

It\u2019ll all come down to company policy, on an organization-by-organization basis, which may leave employees having to make some tough decisions. And that\u2019s one reason we love the surveys, because people keep changing their minds. Just ask staffers at Amazon and IBM. Both companies pulled an about-face last week, announcing changes to their previously statements about flexible work schedules in the After Times. While previous reports stated that Amazon was aiming to return to an office-centric culture, corporate Amazon employees will now be allowed to work remotely up to two days a week, with the possibility of working entirely remotely for up to four weeks a year. The company says it\u2019s \u201clearning and evolving as we go\u201d to explain the change of heart. IBM pulled the opposite move: The tech multinational had hinted at hybrid and remote possibilities earlier in the pandemic, but in a memo to staff this week, they announced that they will be reopening all of their American offices this fall, and that staff will be expected to clock-in in person. Citing \u201cimproving U.S. clinical conditions and broad access to COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d the memo advises all staffers to be prepared to return to their physical office spaces the week of September 7. Facebook is splitting the difference. Starting June 15, Facebook will allow employees to request permanent, remote work arrangements. (Previously, only employees with a certain level of seniority could make this ask.) Hybrid work schedules will also be considered for those whose work requires them to be on-site at least some of the time, and expanded remote work access across international borders is on the table for those who are interested in living and working abroad, reports CNBC. Working from away may come at a price with a clawback in salary, though: CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced last summer that remote work could come with compensation adjustments in line with market values. The country is currently living in two worlds: The broader economy, where the unemployment rate is climbing (up to 8.2 per cent in May, with 68,000 jobs lost in the month amidst lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID), and the tech sector, where they can\u2019t hire fast enough. Amazon has announced plans to hire 1,800 employees coast to coast, and across areas of the business, this year. Shopify, Google, Twitter and Pinterest have also announced hiring plans in Canada. Many Canadian startups \u2014 especially those with a focus on digital transformation \u2014 find themselves with a related issue. With an influx of venture capital investment money as the pandemic winds down, some companies are having to hit fast-forward on a hire that was maybe a few years down the road in the original business plan: a Chief Financial Officer. For organizations that are looking to take their companies public, which may happen sooner depending on the windfalls they\u2019ve received of late, having a CFO in place is crucial. Take Snapcommerce, a Toronto-based e-comm promotions startup. The pandemic accelerated interest in the company, and they closed a $107-million round of venture capital funding in March \u2014 four times what they had raised to date. All of a sudden, the company had an immediate need to beef up their lean finance team. In response, the company announced their new CFO hire last week \u2014 Daniel Weisenfeld, former head of investment-retail banking at Bank of America. Co-founder Hussein Fazal says this hire, as well as appointing Anan Kashyap, CFO of Poshmark, to its board, will help to make the company \u201cIPO-ready.\u201d The pandemic accelerated interest in the company, and they closed a $107-million round of venture capital funding in March \u2014 four times what they had raised to date.

In an age where some of your colleagues will have returned to the office while you\u2019re still at home, it can be difficult to stay top of mind, reports Fast Company. So what can you do to stay on the radar? It\u2019s probably not a shock to learn that employees are lonelier than ever. High-quality connections are vital for people to feel socially fulfilled at work, and \u2014 while the idea of the being lonely at work was emerging before COVID-19 \u2014 the isolation of the pandemic has made fostering interpersonal relationships with colleagues even more difficult. (There\u2019s only so much connection you can get over Zoom.) This means that companies will need to commit to psychological safety \u2014 the idea that it\u2019s okay to take personal risks, like asking questions, admitting mistakes and showing vulnerability \u2014 as well as opportunities to encourage empathy and interdependence among teams.

This isn\u2019t just about social events and team-building exercises, either. (Trust falls aren\u2019t going to fix this one.) Teams need to be structured for collaboration, says the Harvard Business Review, and not just baton-passing work. High levels of interactivity, and the sharing of thoughts and resources, will be important. Add in an element of recognition for people who help to foster interpersonal relationship building at work, and workplace loneliness may be something you can leave behind with the pandemic. We\u2019ll tell you what else you can leave behind with the pandemic and the days of never-ending videoconferencing: blue light glasses. These now-popular specs cropped up on so many work-from-home essentials lists over the past year, touting their ability to temper the effects of blue light emitted from screens, but their effectiveness is cloudy (pun absolutely intended). Digital eye strain is definitely a thing, but the amount of blue light emitted from screens is minimal and there\u2019s no evidence to support that it causes structural damage to the eye. In fact, a recent study in the American Journal of Ophthalmology found no difference in the amount of digital eye strain between a test group using blue light glasses and a placebo group. You\u2019d be better off scheduling in breaks from the screen, and not just for your eyes. Burnout is a real thing. Some Chinese millennials are taking a stand against burnout, in fact, in what they\u2019re calling the \u201clying flat\u201d movement. In response to the hyper-competitive rat race in China, groups of people are \u201clying down\u201d by working a job at their own pace and resting when they need to. They\u2019re also refusing to work overtime, avoiding desk jobs and even not getting married and starting families, in order to buck tradition. In a culture where the 9-9-6 expectation is rampant \u2014 working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week \u2014 it\u2019s a revolt against the convention of overwork. Poor enforcement of labour laws sees people suffering from exhaustion and depression, and in extreme cases, dying at their desks.

The senior officer responsible for human resources in the Canadian Armed Forces, Lieutenant-General Steve Whelan, is calling for the military to keep its promise to address sexual misconduct, after numerous reports of inappropriate behaviour involving senior commanders. Whelan, as head of military personnel, has oversight on everything from recruitment and training to promotions and health care, and will be implementing reforms to various areas that will have a direct impact on Armed Forces culture. Proposals for change will come from a variety of channels, including from retired Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour, who has been conducting a year-long study in order to provide strategy for eliminating sexual misconduct. One would think that an apple left atop a stack of papers when workers evacuated the office in haste 15 months ago would be a \u201cpuddle of putrid goo,\u201d but a deputy managing editor at The Atlantic, Rachel Gutman, accidentally figured out that in certain conditions \u2014 in this case, an empty office in the midst of a pandemic \u2014 the rot stays away and desiccation happens instead. In other words, it dries out instead of liquefying. We were immediately drawn to this story and wondered what we could learn to apply to HR insights. Gutman interviewed food scientists to find out exactly what went on with the shrivelled up, raisin-like apple in question, and it seems \u201c\u2026the apple had benefited from a combination of natural decay processes, a fortuitous lack of fungi, and the very particular environmental conditions of an abandoned, climate-controlled office.\u201d In essence, the apple preserved itself.

In some ways, we\u2019ll all be returning to office weirdness, from the now-ancient snacks in your desk drawer to the remote colleague you\u2019ll work with every day but never see. Well, at least in real life. In an effort to cut down on Zoom fatigue (is this an actual diagnosis?) some companies are investigating bringing hologram technology to the workplace. Yep, you read that right. Organizations like WeWork and Google are hoping to bring holograms and related technology to their boardrooms, as a way to improve communication and help interactions to feel more personal.

It\u2019s a question that appeared, at least to some, to already be nearly answered after a handful of trailblazing companies \u2014 including Tesla Inc., MicroStrategy Inc. and Square Inc. \u2014 incorporated Bitcoin into their balance sheets without igniting a broader corporate revolution. Now, the focus is turning to governments. El Salvador, which started using the U.S. dollar as its currency more than 20 years ago, last week became the first country in the world to pass legislation allowing use of Bitcoin in any transaction. President Nayib Bukele says the point is to counter the fact that relatively few citizens have bank accounts and to cut the cost of sending remittances, or money that workers ship back to their families in El Salvador from other countries. Some observers wonder whether a bigger movement is afoot: replacing a conventional currency \u2014 the dollar, the titan of global commerce and finance \u2014 on a national scale and then beyond. The answer, at least for Julian Sawyer, chief executive officer of Bitstamp, one of the world\u2019s longest-running crypto exchanges, is not quite yet. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people who have sat in the crypto world who\u2019ve said, \u2018Oh, crypto is going to take over the world and traditional banks and central banks will go away,'\u201d he said in a telephone interview from London. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d While the technology itself may be used increasingly in the behind-the-scenes plumbing of financial services, such as money being sent across borders, Sawyer said Bitcoin is still too volatile to fully replace the dollar, though it may become part of the mix. \u201cWill there still be the dollar? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWill there still be Visa and Mastercard? Absolutely. It will just be we\u2019ll have alternatives for using plastic, or paper, or coins or checks.\u201d El Salvador\u2019s central bank president also said on state television that Bitcoin would not replace the greenback in the nation. The dollar is stable, especially when compared with Bitcoin\u2019s explosive price moves. And whereas the dollar usually fluctuates for mundane reasons, crypto can be swayed by tweets, memes and Elon Musk \u2014 not a great fit for a national or global currency. Bitcoin quadrupled last year, while the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slipped 5.5% \u2014 a fairly big number for the greenback. Since mid-April, Bitcoin has lost nearly half of its value. Bank of America Corp. research shows Bitcoin is about four times as volatile as the Brazilian real and Turkish lira \u2014 and neither of those is anyone\u2019s model of stability. \u201cBitcoin injects extra volatility,\u201d which is counterproductive for countries looking for stability, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. \u201cWhy do countries peg their currency to another currency or have a currency board or have a dollarized economy? It\u2019s because their currency has become too volatile or lost credence in the market and become out of control, very inflationary.\u201d Test Case That doesn\u2019t mean other countries won\u2019t look to El Salvador as a test case for what can happen, especially those that benefit from remittance flows or have central banks already researching or piloting cryptocurrencies of their own. \u201cCountries can\u2019t just look away from this option now,\u201d said Valkyrie Investments CEO Leah Wald, who previously worked for the World Bank. \u201cFor the longevity and health and well-being of Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin network, this is the dawn of a new day.\u201d Nations from Haiti to Guatemala, South Sudan and Liberia could be next to adopt Bitcoin given their dependence on remittance inflows, high poverty and low financial inclusion, according to Rahul Shah, Tellimer Ltd.\u2019s head of financials equity research. Other dollarized economies \u2014 those, like El Salvador, that are based on the greenback \u2014 are also candidates to officially adopt Bitcoin and become less dependent on the Federal Reserve and U.S. policies. \u201cIt potentially gives the ability to not be as beholden to the dollar over the long term, and be more independent of the existing financial system,\u201d said Brad Bechtel, global head of currencies at Jefferies. \u201cOnce you see one country go that way, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see more.\u201dEcuador, which has been dollarized for two decades, could also consider Bitcoin, said Emily Weis, a global macro strategist at State Street Corp. Colombia and Mexico, meanwhile, would risk disrupting their local currencies, even if they have large remittances and crypto interest among the local populations, she said.\u201dMany EM populations already have an affinity for cryptocurrencies given capital controls, fragile local market dynamics, and volatility of local currencies,\u201d Weis said. There\u2019s also the related business opportunities: El Salvador\u2019s Bukele, for example, is using the new law as a way to stoke interest in mining Bitcoin in the coastal country. He ordered the president of the state-owned geothermal electric company to make plans to offer greener mining facilities. \u201cAll it takes is one small domino and eventually it can create real change,\u201d said Alex Tapscott of Ninepoint Partners LP, which has a Bitcoin ETF in Canada. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

As part of that spending, the No. 1 U.S. automaker will build two additional U.S. battery plants and move ahead some of its EV investments, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. In November, GM upped its spending plans from $20 billion, a figure that was announced in March before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the auto industry. The Detroit company declined to comment. The expected announcement of increased spending by GM comes less than a month after rival Ford Motor Co upped its EV spending by more than a third to over $30 billion by 2030. The combined $65 billion in commitments by the largest U.S. automakers, as well as increased spending by EV leader Tesla Inc and startups including Lucid and Rivian reflect the EV arms race that has left some automakers like Lordstown Motors Corp scrambling to raise more funds. In addition, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other key Democrats to discuss EVs and vehicle emissions, the sources said. Barra will also meet U.S. Representative Richard Neal, head of the tax policy Ways and Means Committee, Frank Pallone, who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, and two key Michigan Democrats: Representatives Dan Kildee and Debbie Dingell, the sources said. WOOING WASHINGTON Working with Washington is critical as President Joe Biden has proposed $174 billion to boost EVs and charging as part of his infrastructure plan, including $100 billion in new EV rebates. GM\u2019s ability to benefit from the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit has expired. GM has sparred with Democrats over vehicle emissions rules, but last week said it supported overall emissions reductions in California\u2019s 2019 deal with other major automakers. It has also sought more flexibility to hit carbon reduction target between now and 2026. The Associated Press reported on Monday that GM planned to announce two new U.S. battery plants, citing comments by President Mark Reuss. GM confirmed the executive\u2019s comments, but sources said the company has not decided where in the United States to build the plants, which are each expected to cost more than $2 billion. In January, GM said it was setting a goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift away from gasoline and diesel engines. GM and its South Korean joint-venture partner, LG Energy Solution, are already building a battery plant in northeastern Ohio and have announced a second, $2.3 billion battery plant will be located in Spring Hill, Tennessee. GM confirmed in November it would speed up the rollout of new EVs, with plans to offer 30 models globally by 2025, up from a prior target of 20 by 2023. Barra said the automaker wants to exceed annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025. On May 26, a Senate committee advanced legislation that would boost tax credits to as much as $12,500 for EVs assembled by union workers in the United States. The current maximum tax credit is $7,500. The bill also includes a 30% tax credit for manufacturers to retool or build new facilities to produce advanced energy technologies including batteries. That would represent a big boost to GM\u2019s battery factory plans.

Photo Available Here While these claims go back years, Elon Musk recently tweeting that Tesla will suspend accepting Bitcoin payments because of environmental concerns brought these claims to the forefront. Excluded from these reports are the strong arguments saying these claims are unfounded. Oddly, none of the reports attempt to answer the only question that matters \u2013 how much *additional* energy was generated because of crypto mining? Instead, they treat excess energy generated by power plants and used by miners as energy created for the miners \u2013 even though that energy was already created, and would have been wasted otherwise. Unfortunately, the public was presented only one side of the story, and now many see cryptocurrency as harmful to the environment.\u00a0 But The Solar Oil Project represents a step in the right direction for energy production, helping to lower emissions and reduce environmental hazards \u2013 and it\u2019s all powered by crypto\u2026 Beyond Oil\u2122 is excited to announce the launch of a revolutionary tokenization platform \u2013 The\u00a0Solar Oil Project.\u00a0\u00a0 The technology platform aims to be the largest tokenized commodity production and exchange mechanism in the world. The platform supports local oil well operators to deploy innovative technology solutions that dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of oil production while recycling old oil wells that are abandoned or underutilized.\u00a0 This \u2018oil well recycling\u2019 program accomplishes multiple goals from an economic and environmental perspective: The Project uses the Blockchain network to distribute tokenized oil production via ERC-20 token rewards to the users. It uses one of the latest oil extraction technologies, the \u201cAir Lift Technology\u201d (ALT). The Innovation eliminates soil pollution and makes the entire process eco friendly. Photo: Solar Oil Platform is Already LIVE and Fully Functional! The Trillion Dollar Problem\u2026 In the Southern US alone, more than 100,000 Low-Volume Oil Wells are either abandoned or underutilized. These wells can quickly become an ecological hazard and cost close to a Trillion Dollars in clean up across North America. The current estimate for just the cleanup in the US state of Texas alone comes in at over $117 Billion USD.\u00a0 What SOP Intends to do differently\u2026 SOP supplies Operators and Owners with the technology and the expertise to replace the old equipment with solar-powered pumps that are economically viable, efficient, and automated. With this, the wells are given a fresh breath of life into profitable production. This is particularly effective for the well sites that are older and have minimal profit margins with traditional technologies. How the Process Works\u2026 After review by members of the Solar Oil team, selected oil well sites are equipped with eco-friendly pneumatic pumps, solar panels (where applicable), air compressors, and remote monitoring capabilities. The combination of these technologies results in a modern production mechanism that brings these abandoned wells back into active production.\u00a0 Anyone Can Participate, And Enjoy The Rewards\u2026 Perhaps the most attractive part of the project is how it encourages participation of all interested users. Anyone can create a free account on\u00a0Solar Oil\u00a0Project\u2019s website (solaroil.io) and purchase the Solar Oil Access Token (SOAX). This non speculative utility token then gives the user access to the platform where they can assign the access tokens towards the work on selected oil well sites. The revenue generated from the token sales is used to then update the wells in the selected portfolios. Because of this, the token does not meet requirements to be classified as a security, meaning US investors who typically cannot participate in the launch of new crypto-based projects are able to invest in Solar Oil. In return, users who participate in this manner receive a portion of the oil production achieved in the form of the SOPX token \u2013 The Solar Oil Production token. SOPX distribution is in proportion to how many Access tokens a user assigned to the oil portfolio. The SOPX rewards may then be traded on the Commodity Exchange for other commodities, currencies, or crypto assets.\u00a0 This elegant solution allows for equitable rewards distribution for any users that help protect the environment while resulting in profitable energy resource production. About Beyond Oil\u2122 Beyond Oil, led by Chief Strategy Officer Hitesh Juneja, aims to transition the energy sector from fossil fuels to more sustainable green energy overtime in a manner that is practical, and does not cause the economic or ecological harm that sudden and forced changes might cause.\u00a0 To make this happen in a practical manner, Beyond Oil is broken up into three phases with Phase 1, being the Solar Oil Project \u2013 a rare and revolutionary application of technology to address one of the major ecological challenges of our time while providing oil commodity backed token rewards! The goal in this phase is to attract a large number of participants through an attractive, profitable business model. On Phase 2 \u2013 The Open Commodity Exchange: The oil production from the Solar Oil Project is issued to the stakeholders in the form of the ERC-20 token \u2013 SOPX (Solar Oil Production).\u00a0 The SOPX is pegged to the global WTi spot price and is immediately liquidable through the Solar Oil Commodity exchange to a host of other assets such as Gold, Silver, Natural Gas, as well as tens of equities and cryptocurrencies. This represents the first major blockchain development allowing for open exchange between true commodity-backed crypto-assets and other fiat-based assets. \u00a0 The goal of this phase is to establish a robust financial ecosystem that new disruptive technologies can be onboarded into.\u00a0 On Phase 3 \u2013 We are focusing on Emerging Disruptive Technologies: And additional emerging technologies that do not have established profitable business models will be guided to maturity during this phase.\u00a0 For more Information about SOP, kindly get in touch via\u00a0https://solaroil.io\u00a0or\u00a0https://solaroil.io/contact-us    "}, {"source": "Financial Post", "title": "Polestar to make electric SUV at U.S. Volvo plant, starting in 2022 ", "url": "https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/polestar-to-make-electric-suv-at-u-s-volvo-plant-starting-in-2022", "date": "Wed, 16 Jun 2021 10:02:29 GMT", "content": "DETROIT \u2014 Polestar, the premium electric vehicle maker owned by China\u2019s Geely and Volvo Cars, will build its Polestar 3 electric SUV at Volvo\u2019s U.S. plant in South Carolina starting in the second half of 2022, the brand\u2019s chief executive said. Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters in a telephone interview that the Polestar 3 is \u201cnicely suited for the U.S. as a \u2026 big, tall, grown-up SUV. This is a win-win situation.\u201d The Volvo plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina, near Charleston, currently builds the Volvo S60 sedan and will add the Volvo XC90 SUV in 2022, Polestar said on Wednesday. The annual capacity at the plant, which opened in 2018, will be 150,000 vehicles with the Volvo and Polestar SUVs added, a Volvo spokesman said. The Polestar 3 will be built on the same electric premium platform, called the SPA2, as the XC90, Ingenlath said. It will compete with such models as Tesla Inc\u2019s Model X SUV. Sweden\u2019s Volvo Cars is owned by Geely. The Polestar SUV will initially be sold in the United States, but could eventually be exported, Ingenlath said. Polestar, which was launched in 2017, sells the low-volume halo Polestar 1 hybrid performance car for about $155,000. Its first high-volume car, the Polestar 2, sells for about $60,000. Both cars are built in China. Ingenlath said last year Polestar was targeting annual Polestar 2 sales of more than 50,000 vehicles within two to three years. He said that goal has not changed, but declined to give volume targets for the Polestar 3. The company also is developing a larger, more environmentally friendly sedan called Precept and will build that vehicle at a new plant in China. Ingenlath said taking Polestar public remained a possibility, but the focus is on raising funds to help the company grow. Last year he said Polestar would like eventually to be publicly listed. In April, Polestar raised $550 million from investors to accelerate product development and said further fund raising could occur.

The decision is due Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tug-of-war between the understanding that we\u2019re having great economic growth and great earnings growth juxtaposed with the fact that we need to get our head wrapped around what inflation looks like and what it will mean both to profit margins and to the Fed,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief strategist at National Securities.

Equities in Europe look set to nudge up and stay around yesterday\u2019s fresh historic peaks as the recovery-induced trade displays its full potential, and Wall Street too is poised for a positive start after yet another record close. Volatility gauges on both sides of the Atlantic have dipped to new pre-pandemic lows and bond yields across developed counties are moving around the mid point of the last three months\u2019 trading range, illustrating the fairly relaxed mood. The two-day Federal Reserve meeting kicks off today and although it is not expected to announce any plan to pare its bond purchases it may offer hints the discussion has began, amid some concerns about growing inflationary pressures. JP Morgan said the upcoming tapering process was unlikely to hurt its bullish view on equities for the second half of 2021. It expects the Fed to start tapering early next year. Back to today\u2019s agenda, investors will keep an eye on a number of ECB speakers but that comes after abundant reassurances \u2013 the latest from president Lagarde yesterday \u2013 that it\u2019s too early to even talk about withdrawing support. And in Asia Pacific, similar soundings came from Australia, where its central bank members said in the June meeting\u2019s minutes that it was too early to end the bank\u2019s bond buying program. Meantime in Japan a former Bank of Japan policymaker said the bank must eventually consider ways to unload its huge holdings of exchange-traded funds after tapering bond and ETF purchases. But the timing will be years away. On the corporate front, the U.S. and Europe are expected to announce a truce in their 17-year-old dispute over aircraft subsidies on Tuesday. That could help planemakers Boeing and Airbus and also bring relief to other industries. Good news also on the COVID-19 front. A new analysis has shown that vaccines made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca offer protection of more than 90% against hospitalization from the Delta coronavirus variant. Finally, bitcoin steadied after climbing above the $40,000 mark following remarks from Elon Musk who said Tesla may resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.

Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a taper announcement will come in the next quarter, despite a patchy recovery in the job market. \u201cWhilst no immediate changes in monetary policy are anticipated, an increase in the share of FOMC members who think rates will need to increase in 2023 is expected,\u201d analysts at ANZ wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIf three more members pencil in rate rises for 2023, that would tip the majority in favor of moving rates relatively soon,\u201d they said Currency markets were quiet ahead of the meeting, with the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, broadly flat at 90.502 in early Asia trading. Benchmark 10-year yields were 1.4872%, little changed from Monday, when they rebounded from Friday\u2019s three-month low. As for commodities, U.S. crude ticked up 0.55% to $71.27 a barrel, and Brent crude was at $73.24 per barrel, having touched on Monday $73.64 a barrel, its highest since April 2019. Spot gold was down slightly at $1862.21 per ounce. Even bitcoin was fairly quiet, fluctuating a little above $40 000. It rose on Sunday and Monday after Elon Musk said Tesla could resume accepting payment in the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency at some point in the future.

Wabtec, based in Pittsburgh, is developing locomotives powered by electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells in response to rail industry demand to eliminate carbon emissions. It has a test electric locomotive model and intends to build a second generation version, with deliveries starting in 2023. \u201cThe rail industry is on the cusp of a sustainable transformation with the introduction of batteries and hydrogen to power locomotive fleets,\u201d Wabtec Chief Executive Rafael Santana said in a statement. Under the nonbinding memorandum of understanding, GM will supply Ultium electric batteries and Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell power cubes. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. \u201cWabtec\u2019s decision to deploy GM\u2019s Ultium battery and Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell systems further validates our advanced technology,\u201d GM President Mark Reuss said. Ultium is a key part of GM\u2019s strategy to roll out efficient and cost effective electric vehicles, and closing a deal with Wabtec would help spread development costs over a larger volume of batteries. GM is developing a hydrogen fuel-cell-powered commercial truck with truck maker Navistar. GM\u2019s Ultium batteries will be built by the company\u2019s joint venture with South Korea battery maker LG Energy Solution , which is building plants in Ohio and Tennessee. The hydrogen fuel-cell systems will be assembled by GM\u2019s joint venture with Honda in Brownstown, Michigan. Last month, Wabtec announced that its FLXdrive all-electric locomotive, during a test program with BNSF Railway in California, delivered more than an 11% average reduction in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for the entire train \u2013 the equivalent of over 6,200 gallons of diesel fuel saved and about 69 tons of CO2 emissions reduced. It is also developing hydrogen fuel-cell-powered locomotives. The 430,000-pound electric locomotive, with a battery capacity of 2.4 megawatt hours (MWh), uses 18,000 lithium-ion battery cells, Wabtec\u2019s chief technology officer, Eric Gebhardt, said in a recent interview. It generates its energy largely through regenerative braking. The company intends to build a second-generation electric locomotive with a battery capacity of more than 6 MWh, a level it says can reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30%. Gebhardt compared that capacity to 100 Tesla vehicles. Wabtec expects to begin shipments of the second-generation electric locomotive in mid-2023, he said. The company has not disclosed volume targets.

It\u2019s an unexpected priority. Nickel isn\u2019t on the U.S. list of critical minerals. Although the country depends on imports, 68% of supplies come from what the report calls \u201callied nations\u201d such as Canada, Australia, Norway and Finland. But the Department of Energy (DOE) has identified Class 1 nickel, the type best suited to lithium-ion batteries, as both key vulnerability and key opportunity. The emphasis on nickel doesn\u2019t mean the White House is complacent about other critical battery materials such as lithium and cobalt but it says a lot about how the administration is thinking about the problem. LOW RESERVES, NO PROCESSING The United States is import-dependent across the spectrum of battery metals with large parts of the supply chain captured by China, a problematic international trading partner. However, the nature of the dependency differs by mineral, starting in the ground. The United States, for example, \u201chas lithium resources and domestic corporations well-versed in recovery and refinement globally,\u201d according to the report. The ambition, therefore, is to stimulate more domestic mining and, even more importantly, domestic processing through a potential mix of purchasing guarantees, federal funding and research and development into enhanced recovery technology. China\u2019s investment in this section of the supply chain \u201chas made them the world\u2019s leader despite limited domestic lithium supply,\u201d the report notes. When it comes to nickel, however, the only active U.S. mine \u2013 Eagle in Michigan \u2013 is due to retire in 2025 and domestic deposits are small and low grade. There is no domestic nickel processing capacity outside a limited amount of by-product salt production. Yet this particular battery metal is the one likely to experience the most significant demand increase over the coming years, the report says, with \u201cmarket indications that there could be a large shortage of Class 1 nickel in the next 3-7 years.\u201d Indeed, with nickel content rising in battery cathode design, not having enough of the right kind of nickel \u201cposes a supply chain risk for battery manufacturing globally, not just in the United States.\u201d RE-DESIGNING DEMAND Nickel demand is rising because automakers are trying to reduce their usage of cobalt, a metal that is overshadowed by a supply-chain reliance on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its artisanal workforce. The Department of Energy wants to help them with a commitment to \u201ca multi-year initiative to address the scientific and engineering issues with reducing and eliminating the cobalt in EV batteries.\u201d Research is already taking place into new materials such as silicon and lithium metal anodes with progress to date \u201cvery good,\u201d the report says. The motivation is the same as that of Tesla or Volkswagen. Changing the demand dynamic is the surest long-term way of resolving cobalt\u2019s cost and supply problems. The DOE awarded cobalt the \u201clowest \u2018quality\u2019 supply chain score of all elements, largely due to the alleged mining conditions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and conditions surrounding cobalt refining in China.\u201d But with most of the world\u2019s known cobalt reserves in the Congo, there\u2019s an acceptance that short-term risks can only be partly mitigated through a combination of maximizing domestic resources, particularly old tailings, and working with allied countries. The report recommends using the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to \u201cidentify projects in allied and partner nations that can be funded to create new sustainable mining and processing operations for lithium, graphite, and other key metals and materials.\u201d RECYCLING Also critical to reducing critical minerals dependence will be building recycling capacity, according to the DOE. Battery recycling could meet up to 30% of nickel and 80% of cobalt usage in electric vehicles by the end of the decade but there are multiple hurdles in getting there. It will require a national recycling policy to align a sector that is currently fragmented by state legislation. Without one batteries will go to landfill or be exported to other countries where the metals will be extracted. It will also need more research and development on how to recycle electric vehicle batteries because it\u2019s currently unprofitable in many cases and is becoming more chemically difficult as battery ingredients multiply. Ideally, it should take place in tandem with a build-out of other parts of the battery supply chain such as cell and pack manufacture, allowing \u201cnew\u201d scrap to be continuously looped back into the production process. The report recommends the United States should form a cross-agency task force to \u201ccapture a holistic view of the opportunity landscape and to coordinate action to support domestic recycling.\u201d Despite the long list of challenges, the DOE concludes that recycled material can \u201cbuffer volume and price instabilities\u201d in the short term and, as ever more EV batteries reach end-of-life, \u201ccould eventually supply a significant share of critical battery material needs.\u201d NICKEL URGENCY Recycling will likely help close the U.S. dependency gap faster in cobalt than it will in nickel. This is because the current recyclables stream is largely made up of consumer electronics and first-generation EVs, neither of which contain much nickel. The world is going to need a lot more new nickel before recycling can make a real impact. There is a nickel mining and processing boom underway in Indonesia but rather than offering any comfort to the United States, the dominance of Chinese players simply means the country risks \u201cfalling further behind China in this critical mineral.\u201d As such, \u201cthere is urgency to developing a strategy around Class 1 nickel,\u201d the report concludes. Starting with a U.S.-funded nickel processing plant.

In November, GM upped its spending plans from $20 billion, a figure that was announced in March before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the auto industry. The Detroit company declined to comment. The expected announcement of increased spending by GM comes less than a month after rival Ford Motor Co upped its EV spending by more than a third to over $30 billion by 2030.

It has also sought more flexibility to hit carbon reduction target between now and 2026.

GM confirmed the executive's comments, but sources said the company has not decided where in the United States to build the plants, which are each expected to cost more than $2 billion. In January, GM said it was setting a goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift away from gasoline and diesel engines. GM and its South Korean joint-venture partner, LG Energy Solution, are already building a battery plant in northeastern Ohio and have announced a second, $2.3 billion battery plant will be located in Spring Hill, Tennessee. GM confirmed in November it would speed up the rollout of new EVs, with plans to offer 30 models globally by 2025, up from a prior target of 20 by 2023. Barra said the automaker wants to exceed annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025. On May 26, a Senate committee advanced legislation that would boost tax credits to as much as $12,500 for EVs assembled by union workers in the United States.

Some investors are wagering that Wall Street's preference for green energy will depress spending on oil extraction, setting the stage for supply shortages and higher fuel prices. The bets come as money managers line up trillions of dollars for wind, solar and other renewable programs and expenditures on oil projects tumble. The drop in fossil-fuel spending is becoming so severe that energy companies could struggle to quench the world's thirst for oil, some analysts say. Crude is still expected to remain in high demand over the next decade to make transportation fuels and petrochemicals used for plastics and other household products. U.S. consumption has surged lately following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, and output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have given prices a further boost. U.S. crude recently hit $70 a barrel, its highest level in more than 2 1/2 years, and has roughly doubled since the end of October. Some traders are using options, which allow the holder to buy or sell an asset at a specific price in the future, to wager on prices hitting $100 by the end of next year. Even after OPEC and its allies lift output in the months ahead, some analysts think production will struggle to catch up to demand, which the International Energy Agency projects will rise at least through 2026. Spending on oil extraction fell last year to about $330 billion, less than half the total from its 2014 record, according to research firm Wood Mackenzie. That figure is expected to rise just modestly this year and in the years ahead. Leigh Goehring, managing partner at commodities-focused investment firm Goehring & Rozencwajg Associates, said he thinks prices will soar in coming years as consumption tops production capacity for a sustained period for the first time ever. His firm lifted its investments in energy producers during last year's crash and has maintained those holdings. \"This is the basis for the next oil crisis,\" he said. \"We're in uncharted territory.\" View of the pumpjack in the oil well of the oil field. The arrangement is commonly used for onshore wells producing little oil. Pumpjacks are common in oil-rich areas. Analysts say an oil-price surge could happen like this: As more people resume travel following the pandemic, demand is expected to rise. That would allow OPEC to ease supply restrictions and lower global inventories of crude. If consumption continues climbing beyond 2022 as many expect, the world would then need more oil from the same companies currently being told by investors to limit spending, resulting in a supply shortfall. OPEC has the ability to quickly increase production, and there are currently ample reserves that could be tapped to respond to price spikes. But many on Wall Street are retreating from the fossil-fuel industry, leaving investors questioning whether companies would be able to raise enough money to fill any longer-term supply gaps. In recent years, growing output from U.S. shale producers and giant oil companies suppressed prices. Now, many analysts doubt that these companies will rapidly beef up spending in the face of industry consolidation and mounting environmental pressure. Energy firms have recently slashed the value of their assets by tens of billions of dollars as the sector copes with last year's wave of bankruptcies and project setbacks. Planned investment in oil supply globally falls about $600 billion short of what will be needed to meet projected demand by 2030, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Christyan Malek. Pressure to deliver cash to shareholders, partly driven by worries about the long-run outlook for oil demand, has limited the industry's ability to plow money into new projects, he said. \"It's just hard to see where the capital is going to come from to grow at a rate that will be needed from 2022,\" said David Meaney, founding principal of Assert Capital Management LP. The Dallas-based hedge fund is positioning for higher oil prices through futures and options. The wagers are a reminder that the unprecedented transition to renewables and electric vehicles is still in its early stages and could go through several phases. It also shows the challenges facing producers like Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. In addition to concerns about spending and shareholder returns, they are contending with mandates to limit environmental damage. Shell said last week that it would accelerate efforts to cut emissions following a Dutch court ruling ordering the company to take more drastic action. As the economy recovers from the pandemic, the question confronting the energy industry is whether demand will eventually fall to match limited supplies, investors say. That reverses a decadeslong paradigm of wondering if production can catch up to consumption, with Wall Street debating uncertain estimates about the speed of the renewable transition. \"I'm bullish on electric vehicles. It still takes time before they can take a meaningful chunk out of oil demand,\" said Jason Bordoff, a former Obama administration energy adviser and the founding director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. A wind turbine farm owned by PacifiCorp near Glenrock, Wyo. (AP Photo/Matt Young, File) (AP) Another obstacle for producers: declining output from existing wells over time. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. remains about 60% below levels from the end of 2018 even as prices have surged, figures from Baker Hughes show. \"Investors have made it clear to the energy sector: 'Don't spend a lot of money,'\" said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at energy asset manager Tortoise. \"Boards and management teams have to listen to the shareholders.\" The energy industry isn't alone in its cautious approach. Miners, which burned through cash the last time industrial metals prices shot higher, have also been reluctant to drive money into projects because investors have encouraged greater discipline. Some analysts argue that concerns about a dearth of oil are overstated, particularly when large suppliers are still intentionally withholding copious amounts due to coronavirus disruptions. Producers and investors might be less disciplined in limiting capital spending and supply if prices surge and they could profit, they say. But for now, many are positioning for shortages. Hayal Ahmadzada, chief trading officer at the trading arm of Azerbaijan's national oil company, drives a Tesla Inc. electric car but expects crude to rise above $100 a barrel next year. \"The transition has to be very careful to avoid the big disruptions,\" he said.

In under two decades, this electric vehicle (EV) maker has disrupted a 130-year-old industry. Not surprisingly, shares of Tesla are up 860%. But even after those gains, Tesla stock could still crush the market over the next decade. Here's why. On several occasions, CEO Elon Musk has mentioned manufacturing\u00a0as Tesla's long-term advantage. That may be surprising, but the company has made great strides in its pursuit of efficiency. Image source: Tesla. In 2017, Tesla introduced the 2170 battery cell, boosting energy capacity by 50%. The company started producing the new cell at the Gigafactory in Nevada, and by mid-2018, that factory was the highest-volume battery plant in the world. In 2019, Tesla completed\u00a0construction of Gigafactory Shanghai in just 10 months, expanding total capacity and localizing its China business. That cut costs by reducing the number of cars shipped across the ocean on boats. In 2020, Tesla broke ground on new Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas, and expects to deliver vehicles from both plants in 2021. Similar to China, this will drive efficiency by expanding capacity and localizing its European business. Notably, even without a factory in Europe, the Model 3 was still the best-selling premium sedan worldwide in Q1 2021. Put another way, with just two factories, Tesla delivered enough vehicles to surpass the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes E-Class. Here's the big picture: Since 2017, Tesla's pursuit of efficiency has paid off in a big way. Its average cost per vehicle dropped 55% ($84,000 to $38,000) and Tesla achieved an industry-leading operating margin of 6.3% in 2020. Currently, even the highest estimates put Tesla's battery costs\u00a0at $187 per kilowatt-hour\u00a0(kWh) -- that's 10% cheaper than the next closest competitor, and 24% cheaper than the industry average. To add, Tesla also sells the only\u00a0EV that exceeds 400 miles in range. In other words, Tesla's batteries cost less and they go farther. Image source: Tesla. In 2020, Tesla introduced another game changer: the 4680 battery cell. Built with an innovative tabless design, this new cell is expected to cut battery costs by 56%, widening Tesla's lead over the industry. Management also believes the 4680 will boost range by 54% and reduce capital expenditures by 69%. That last figure is particularly noteworthy, as it makes this technology highly scalable. In other words, Tesla will spend less on plants and equipment (on a relative basis), but it will produce batteries with a greater range at a lower cost. Tying everything together, Musk believes these efficiencies will allow Tesla to build a $25,000 car within three years. Theoretically, no competitor will be able to match that price, which should help Tesla take market share. Tesla is a frontrunner in the race to build an autonomous vehicle. Its autopilot and full self-driving platforms already offer some automation, but they also serve another purpose: crowdsourcing data. Tesla has over 1 million vehicles on the road, all with external cameras to capture video. As a result, the company had collected 3 billion\u00a0miles of autopilot data by February 2020. By comparison, Alphabet's Waymo -- the first and only company to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service -- had just 20 million\u00a0real-world miles at the time. Image source: Getty Images. That's a big deal. Data is the foundation of artificial intelligence, and Tesla has a significant advantage. To further that edge, it's also building Dojo. This is a supercomputer designed to train the deep neural networks (i.e. AI engines) that will make Tesla's cars autonomous. Notably, Musk believes Dojo\u00a0will be an  order of magnitude  more efficient\u00a0than the next best solution. Here's the big picture: Research from Ark Invest suggests that autonomous ride-hailing platforms could earn $1.2 trillion\u00a0in annual operating profits by 2030. Cathie Wood's team also believes autonomous EV makers will earn $250 billion each year. Tesla falls into both categories, as it plans to launch a ride-hailing network in the future. If Ark is right, Tesla's many advantages -- manufacturing, innovation, and autonomous technology -- should help it capture a good portion of a $1.45 trillion market opportunity. That's why, despite an outrageous valuation of 600 times earnings, I think Tesla could still crush the market.

Six months doesn't make a trend, but this is a notable performance from GM and may show the market starting to value the products GM has been developing for years.\u00a0It could also be argued that Tesla stock had become overvalued, but valuation has never held Tesla back before. So, how could an old, Detroit-based company beat Elon Musk and Tesla if the world is moving toward EVs and autonomous vehicles? GM's shift to EVs and its investments in autonomy may be driving the stock performance in 2021 and given recent announcements from GM I think the outperformance could continue for years.\u00a0  GM data by YCharts A few years ago, Tesla had a huge lead over the competition in electric vehicles. Manufacturers were still making vehicles with ranges of 50 to 100 miles even as Tesla was passing 300 miles of range with some models. It seemed automakers would never catch up.\u00a0 Today, the competition is much more compelling for EV buyers; depending on what you value, Tesla may not be the best EV option. You can see in the table below that multiple EV models are on the market at a similar price point and range as the Model 3, with competitors coming to every segment of the EV market.\u00a0 Source: Company websites.\u00a0 Tesla has been operating from a point of strength and differentiation in the EV market for years. But that differentiation has diminished, and companies like GM are coming into the market with compelling options. The Chevy Bolt was the first full EV from GM, but the Hummer EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, and the electric Silverado are on the way, and GM's shift into EVs is already eating into Tesla's lead.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Autonomy is the other reason investors may see a brighter future at GM than at Tesla. On the surface, it appears that Tesla is a leader in autonomous driving because it has released some self-driving features to its vehicles with Autopilot and has collected data from millions of miles of customers driving, most of which is video and intervention data when Autopilot is active.\u00a0In reality, Tesla is likely years behind competitors, in part because it's using a vision system while most competitors are using LiDAR technology in combination with vision and other sensors. Competitors like Cruise and Waymo also haven't autonomous features to the public -- and may never do so in passenger vehicles.\u00a0 Research from firms like Navigant Research\u00a0suggests that Tesla is behind Ford, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo, General Motors's Cruise subsidiary, and many other companies in both technology and strategy for autonomous driving. But we don't need to look any further than what competitors have submitted to regulators and are being approved for in the autonomous market to show how far behind Tesla is.  Earlier this month, GM's Cruise unit was the first company permitted by California regulators to operate self-driving, ride-sharing vehicles with customers and no backup driver. Seven other companies have also been given permits to test self-driving vehicles in California without a driver and with no passengers allowed. Tesla, which is based in the state, is NOT one of them. The company could be testing in states like Texas and Arizona, where it has operations, but Tesla has yet to report full self-driving data and it's unclear how technology that would enable driving without a driver is being tested.\u00a0\u00a0 The number of autonomous driving miles in California is also telling. After driving 12.2 autonomous miles with a safety driver in 2019, Tesla drove ZERO fully autonomous miles in 2020, according to California regulators. By comparison, Cruise and Waymo have driven more than 3.5 million combined autonomous miles in the last two years. Even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has more autonomous miles than Tesla on California roads. \u00a0  Source: California DMV.\u00a0 Tesla has begun to admit publicly that its Autopilot feature is a driver-assist system not anywhere near a fully autonomous driving system. Car and Driver reported that Tesla's associate general counsel Eric C. Williams wrote the following in a letter to the California Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV):  Currently neither Autopilot nor FSD Capability is an autonomous system, and currently no comprising feature, whether singularly or collectively, is autonomous or makes our vehicles autonomous.  Williams even called Autopilot a Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 2 automation system, which is well below the Level 5 autonomy that Musk has been projecting for years (see fellow Motley Fool John Rosevear's article on the distinction between levels of autonomy here). Tesla is also far behind Cruise and Waymo, which are testing Level 4 autonomy.\u00a0 The lack of fully autonomous testing on public roads in its home state shows that Tesla may not have the same ambitions in autonomous driving as GM (Cruise) and Alphabet (Waymo).\u00a0 Tesla is certainly growing revenue, and that will continue as it expands production. And we can't forget that the Tesla brand has a loyal following that may be willing to pay a premium for electric vehicles, even if features are similar to competitors.\u00a0But as we look out five to ten years, it may be companies like General Motors that provide a bigger opportunity for investors, and that's what we're seeing the market react to.\u00a0 In the next few years, GM's growing lineup of EVs will grow and fill parts of the market that Tesla can't with its limited lineup. The Bolt fills the budget need; the electric Silverado could do really well in the truck market; and the LYRIQ and Hummer are compelling in the luxury-vehicle market. And with ranges and costs that are competitive with Tesla, GM is catching and may potentially surpass Tesla in range and performance of EVs with some vehicles.\u00a0 Long term, autonomous vehicles and autonomous ride-sharing could be the biggest growth segments in the auto industry, and it's clear that in the fully autonomous arena that Cruise has a lead over Tesla. And Cruise is already building a ride-sharing business with real customers. Tesla has been talking about robotaxis for years but isn't testing the technology in California, which doesn't appear to be anywhere near becoming a reality.\u00a0 When you add in the fact that GM is more profitable than Tesla today, it makes sense that investors like the stock. In fact, GM's market cap of $88 billion is still less than 20% of Tesla's $583 billion market cap.  GM Market Cap data by YCharts The tide seems to have turned for GM and against Tesla so far in 2021 as GM releases more EVs and autonomous features into the world. That's a relatively short-term move in the grand scheme of the auto business, but\u00a0given their operating trends, I think GM's outperformance could continue. GM may not be the high-profile stock that Tesla is, but I think it's a great auto stock for the next decade, especially if Cruise comes to redefine personal transportation in metro areas.\u00a0  "}, {"source": "Motley Fool", "title": "Why Sharing Its Charging Network Could Help Tesla ", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-sharing-its-charging-network-could-help-tesla/", "date": "Thu, 17 Jun 2021 13:17:00 GMT", "content": "Reports are circulating this week that electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) could potentially agree to share its Supercharger network with other automakers in Germany. With more than 25,000 Superchargers globally, spread across more than 2,700 Supercharger stations, Tesla has the world's largest network of rapid chargers for electric vehicles (EVs). The charging network is arguably a competitive advantage for Tesla, as it makes long-distance traveling easy and convenient -- something that can't be said for many of the EV-maker's competitors. But if Tesla began sharing its network with other automakers, could it help them play catch-up and ultimately eat into Tesla's growth opportunity? Image source: Tesla.  I am in direct contact with manufacturers such as Tesla in order to ensure that the existing infrastructure, for example Tesla Supercharger, is also opened up to other manufacturers,  said Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer in an interview for a German newspaper on Tuesday. Though the minister admitted that there are some technical issues to address before it can come to a resolution with Tesla, the goal would be that there's  barrier-free use of the charging stations of all providers for all e-cars,  Scheuer said. If Tesla opens up its charging network to other EV manufacturers in Germany, those car brands would have an equally-as-convenient solution for long-distance travel. But there would likely be a positive impact on Tesla from the move -- one that could more than offset the loss of any competitive edge from keeping its chargers to itself: The convenience of a shared network would likely help EVs gain more traction with consumers, creating awareness and ultimately more demand for the newer vehicle technology. It's important to remember that EVs are still a sliver of the overall market: 97% of vehicles sold globally in 2020 were internal combustion (ICE)-powered vehicles. With such low market share, anything that helps fuel greater mass-market adoption of EVs could prove to be a significant catalyst for Tesla. This is why Tesla isn't focused on competition in the EV space but rather the massive market for ICE vehicles. Tesla actually offered to provide automakers access to the company's Supercharger network more than five years ago. Revealing the offer at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting, CEO Elon Musk told investors that doing so would help validate the feasibility of EVs. The catch? Automakers tapping into the network would have to help pay their share of operating expenses related to the network. If opening up the network in Germany would lead to a similar arrangement, these shared economics could be another potential benefit for Tesla. While it's impossible to know what the impact a shared Supercharger network would have on Tesla's competitiveness, it's safe to say that it's unlikely to negatively impact the company's long-term growth prospects in any meaningful way. Furthermore, it's more likely that it would help Tesla.

Historically, Musk has made some bold claims online, and not all of his ideas have come to fruition. For this reason, it made headlines when Tesla actually filed for trademarks in the restaurant services industry -- over three years later. \u00a0Despite the hype, if Tesla goes through with a restaurant in its Supercharger network, investors need to carefully consider whether it is a worthwhile investment of capital and management energy. Image source: Tesla. Tesla's Supercharger network consists of 908 Supercharger stations \u00a0across the country, each with varying numbers of individual Superchargers. The problem is that charging a Tesla takes time, and the company wants to provide Tesla drivers with entertainment while they wait to hit the road again. However, doing some digging on Tesla's Supercharger map reveals some insight into this problem. In the U.S., not a single Supercharger can be found beyond a short walking distance to a restaurant, coffee shop, grocery store, or service plaza. Tesla has located most Supercharger stations near several of these establishments, and some even have direct access to shopping centers. \u00a0 With Supercharger stations already providing Tesla drivers with options for spending their downtime, the Supercharger network does not translate to a surefire captive market for Tesla. However, Elon is set on bringing retro-style entertainment to the Supercharger network in hopes that it will nonetheless drive revenue and attract new customers. Before addressing this question, it's important to understand all the charging options that Tesla drivers have. Supercharger stations, destination chargers, and at-home chargers all have different use cases, pros, and cons. Supercharger stations are located in most major cities and along popular travel routes for high-speed charging during long-distance drives. \u00a0A standard Tesla Model 3 can charge to full capacity in under an hour at a Supercharger. Charging fees can vary based on location, charge volume, and seasonality but generally run around 28 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). \u00a0 Destination chargers are installed by Tesla's 'Charging Partners'\u00a0-- usually shopping centers, hotels, movie theaters, or restaurants -- and allow patrons of those businesses to charge for free. A destination charger's speed is significantly lower than a Supercharger, but drivers can easily reach half or full battery capacity for free while shopping or staying at a hotel. Drivers' final charging option is to use their at-home charger, which is included with every Tesla vehicle purchase. The added utility expense varies based on location, but the average U.S. electricity rate runs about 13.2 cents per kWh -- less than half the price of using a Supercharger. \u00a0 With the ability to charge cheaply at home and free at over 4,500 destination chargers across the country, it's perfectly logical in many cases for a Tesla driver to never use a Supercharger. Essentially, the only use case for a Supercharger is a road trip, and even in those cases many drivers would likely choose other food, coffee, or shopping options in the area over Tesla's proposed retro diner while they wait. Knowing this, it is difficult to argue that it would be worth it for Tesla to invest so heavily in enhancing user experience in the less-frequented Supercharger network. Plus, considering the business incentive for being a Tesla Charging Partner, it's plausible to expect businesses to open destination chargers at a faster rate than Tesla launches new Supercharger stations. There is undoubtedly a lucrative captive market opportunity in electric vehicle charging in general. However, that opportunity will likely be more valuable for Tesla's Charging Partners via destination chargers than for Tesla via its Supercharger network because of the frequency of their respective usage and driver options during their charge time. Especially considering the restaurant industry's infamously razor-thin margins, most investors would prefer to see Tesla stay focused on expanding production capacity, recovering its sales slump in China, and fixing the  significant mistakes  it made in rolling out its solar roof business. If not, the diversion of company resources to a restaurant venture will very likely hurt the stock.

Musk is the founder and CEO of electric vehicle company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and said his company will once again start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment once certain renewable-energy criteria are met. Considering some blame Musk for the current Bitcoin bear market, it seems only fitting that it's getting a boost from him today. Stocks tied to Bitcoin are also getting a boost today. As of 12:30 p.m. EDT, Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) stock is up 21%, Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT) is up 25%, and Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) is up 18%. Finally, shares of cryptocurrency fund Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (OTC:GDLC) are up 12%. Image source: Getty Images. The price of Bitcoin crashed in May after Musk said Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, citing concerns over lack of sustainable energy used in the mining process. At its high in May, Bitcoin was around $58,000. Following Musk's comments, it plummeted to around $35,000. But in a social media post yesterday, Musk said that Tesla isn't banning Bitcoin payments forever. First, the company needs to confirm around half of Bitcoin's electricity comes from green sources. Second, the mining process needs to be trending greener in general. It's unclear how Tesla will confirm Bitcoin's energy sources exactly. By some estimates, the blockchain network already far surpasses Musk's 50% benchmark. For example, according to a December 2019 study from CoinShares Research, 73% of Bitcoin's energy comes from renewable sources. However, the exact percentage is hotly debated. After all, not all miners disclose where they get their electricity. This uncertainty has some calling for more transparency among Bitcoin miners. Therefore, some companies have voluntarily coalesced to form the Bitcoin Mining Council.\u00a0These companies met for the first time on May 23. MicroStrategy is a founding member of the council, and its CEO Michael Saylor said on social media that the council will  standardize energy reporting.  Riot Blockchain, Bit Digital, and Marathon Digital are all companies that mine Bitcoin, and they know how important this renewable energy issue is becoming for Bitcoin. For example, on June 8, Bit Digital provided a transcript of CEO Bryan Bullett's presentation at the LD Micro Conference. There Bullett said,  As of April 2021, we estimated that we used a majority carbon-free energy, on an annualized weighted average basis, accounting for these seasonal migrations.  By  seasonal migrations  Bullett is referring to Bit Digital's strategy of moving miners to places that may have cheaper, renewable energy at certain times of year. Image source: Getty Images. Today's news about Tesla and Bitcoin may send the price of Bitcoin higher only in the short term -- it doesn't seem fundamental to a cryptocurrency-investing thesis. Consider that during the short time Tesla was theoretically allowing Bitcoin as a method of payment, it doesn't seem like anyone actually did it. And in reality it's hard to see what the advantage would be for a consumer anyway. Bitcoin investors believe the value will continue to rise over time. Therefore, it behooves them to hold Bitcoin rather than spend it. Comments today from billionaire Paul Tudor Jones are more fundamental to a long-term Bitcoin thesis. Jones appeared on CNBC today and said he wants 5% of his investments in Bitcoin.\u00a0Jones cited concerns over inflation of the U.S. dollar and high stock valuations, but the implications are far reaching. If more people, companies, and even countries buy and hold Bitcoin as Jones and others suggest, that could create a surge in demand that drives the price higher in the long term. A higher price for Bitcoin would obviously be good for companies like Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain, and Bit Digital that directly operate in this space and even hold bitcoins on their balance sheets in some cases. But it would also be good for funds like Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund -- a diversified cryptocurrency fund that's 69% invested in Bitcoin.\u00a0 If you decide to take Jones' advice regarding Bitcoin, be mentally prepared for volatility. Even though Bitcoin's market capitalization is roughly $750 billion, a simple social media post from a celebrity still amazingly has the power to send coins moving by 10% or more with ease. Expect many more headline-grabbing endorsers and detractors in the coming weeks and months, making for one choppy ride. That may be more than most investors can mentally handle with 5% of their portfolios.\u00a0  "}, {"source": "The Motley Fool", "title": "How Elon Musk's Tweets Move the Cryptocurrency Market ", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/how-elon-musks-tweets-move-the-cryptocurrency-mark/", "date": "Thu, 17 Jun 2021 15:41:07 GMT", "content": "Significant price fluctuations are common in the famously volatile cryptocurrency market, but there's a curious trend emerging over the last year or so: whenever Tesla\u00a0and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweets about a crypto coin, the price often shoots to the sky or sinks like a stone. Musk has embraced the cryptocurrency community with open arms, positioning himself as the world's best-known Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) fan and briefly boosting the fortunes of Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC). The market is susceptible to the changing winds of social media sentiment, and Musk has become the face of that up-and-down action thanks to his expansive reach, including 57 million Twitter\u00a0followers. Image Source: Getty Images He's a champion to Dogecoin investors in particular, as his frequently shared memes and goofy tweets often result in a notable price leap for the  joke  coin. However, Musk's recent dabbling in the Bitcoin market has lost him some fans in the process, given how much the price has dipped following big news he shared from Tesla. Here's a look at how Musk's Twitter use has impacted the crypto markets. As the CEO of multiple major firms, Musk's public affection for Dogecoin and its community might catch some investors off-guard. He has called himself the  former CEO of Dogecoin  and  The Dogefather,  and briefly planned to sell a non-fungible token (NFT) original music video inspired by DOGE before deciding to hold onto it (the top bid was over $1.1 million). Musk first came out as a Dogecoin fan in March 2020 and has since tweeted about it many times, often with a startling price jump thereafter. For example, when Musk tweeted a Lion King-inspired Dogecoin meme in February 2021, the price jumped more than 50%. When he teased a Dogecoin cameo for his May Saturday Night Live hosting gig, the price increased by more than 20%. As of this writing, Dogecoin's price is up more than 5,800% since the start of the year, and Musk's continued impact is hard to deny. Still, not every Musk move pumps DOGE's price: it dropped some 30% after his SNL appearance, during which he joked that it was a  hustle.  Doge hype deflated! Could Musk's positive price impact extend to Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency and most valuable coin by market cap? For a while, yes. Musk began tweeting occasionally about Bitcoin in 2020 and even changed his Twitter profile to simply say  #bitcoin  in January 2021, starting a trend among other influencers. A study from the Blockchain Research Lab suggests that the move led to a 19% increase in Bitcoin's price over the span of seven hours. In February 2021, Musk sent the price of Bitcoin soaring when he announced that Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency to hold as a reserve asset, and that the company would soon accept BTC payments for its electric cars. Bitcoin's price rose by more than 10% soon after, hitting a new all-time high price, and continued climbing in the days and weeks thereafter. That building momentum came crashing down in May, however, when Musk announced that Tesla would stop accepting Bitcoin payments due to the environmental impact of Bitcoin's energy-intensive mining process. Musk tweeted the news from his own personal account, and Bitcoin's price rapidly sank: it dropped from around $55,000 to about $48,000 within 24 hours, and has since seen recent lows around $32,000. Musk has lost some of his crypto-enthusiast admirers as a result, but to be fair, he has helped nudge the price back upwards too\u2014such as this week, when he tweeted that Tesla could eventually resume Bitcoin transactions once enough of the mining apparatus goes green. Bitcoin's price is up more than 20% over the last week. Whether silly or serious, Musk's tweets about cryptocurrency always seem to have some kind of impact on the price of the coin in question. However, as cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream and the market hopefully calms, we'll see how long that remains true. Ethereum\u00a0co-creator Vitalik Buterin, for example, recently told CNN that he believes that the crypto market will gradually build an  immune system  against such social media meddling.  Elon is not going to have this influence forever,  he said. Frazzled cryptocurrency investors can only hope that Buterin is right.

Some stocks, most notably\u00a0Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA), have been highfliers as excitement about electric vehicles has grown. But there are a lot of risks that come with investing in an emerging technology, and inevitably not all of the dozens of EV stocks that have attracted investor attention in recent years will be good long-term investments.\u00a0 Of course, there will be some winners coming out of this period. Here's why three Fool controbutors believe Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Churchill Capital IV (Lucid Motors) (NYSE:CCIV), and EHang Holdings (NASDAQ:EH) are set to thrive over the long term. Image source: Getty Images. Lou Whiteman (Ford Motor):\u00a0Ford has gone from a 117-year-old dinosaur to buzzworthy in less time than it takes one of its Mustang sports cars to go from zero to 60. The company had been seen as a laggard in the electric vehicle revolution, but Ford changed all that last month when it laid out its strategy to transform the business into a 21st-century tech powerhouse. Ford unveiled an electric version of its mainstay F-150 pickup, announced plans to begin over-the-air updates to add computing power to its vehicles and open the door to optional revenue-generating services, and said it was going all-in on new tech. In the days since, Ford unveiled the Maverick, a new hybrid compact pickup truck that it believes will attract a new crowd to the pickup truck market. (Ford might be right. It's the first pickup I've ever wanted to own.) Ford has rarely, if ever, in recent memory made a misstep with its F-150, and the new Lightning electric version looks like a hit both with consumers and Ford's commercial customers. All-electric fleets make a lot of sense for big commercial operations, and Ford's rolling out a suite of new fleet management software features to small and mid-sized operators to help manage maintenance and reliability. In short Ford has not just crashed the gate to enter the electric vehicle party, it suddenly looks like one of the stars of the show. The shares have reacted accordingly, at least by traditional automaker standards, with the stock up 75% year to date. The stock rally isn't an overreaction. Rather, I believe it is a realization by the market that it had underappreciated Ford's wherewithal and ability to survive and thrive in this new world. It's a good time to kick the tires on this auto stock. John Rosevear (Churchill Capital IV/Lucid Motors):\u00a0I met Lucid Motors' CEO, Peter Rawlinson, at an auto show a few years back. At the time, Rawlinson -- who was, among other things, the chief engineer of Tesla's groundbreaking Model S -- was still building out Lucid's team and refining its prototype Air sedan. But he impressed me with his plan, which was to follow Tesla's path to the mass market without repeating what he clearly saw as some of Tesla's mistakes. Part of that plan involved doing something that Tesla has always seemed reluctant to do: drawing on the existing auto industry's best practices for manufacturing and product development. Rawlinson's plan was to fuse those best practices with the kind of innovation needed to build the next Tesla Model S. It sounded great at the time, and I've been impressed by how well he and his team have delivered so far. The Lucid Air, a sedan that promises to combine massive speed and range with genuine luxury, is the first product of that plan. Production of the Air will begin at Lucid's Arizona factory this fall, but there are already more Lucids in the pipeline, including a big luxury SUV and a battery-pack product similar to Tesla's Powerwalls. Lucid will begin shipping the first examples of its Air luxury sedan this fall. More Lucids, including a big SUV, will follow. Image source: Lucid Motors. The Air is a real luxury sedan with real luxury-sedan pricing, starting around $70,000 after tax credits and topping out at about $160,000. While Lucid does plan to introduce more affordable vehicles over the next few years, the scale of its ambitions is more modest than Tesla's grandiose  secret plan.  I actually think that's bullish, because it means that Lucid will have to deliver in order to earn a valuation more like Tesla's.\u00a0 I think the company has everything it needs to do exactly that.\u00a0 Right now, Lucid's valuation is less than 2% of Tesla's. While I do think that Tesla's stock price will come back to Earth at some point, I also think that shows us that Lucid -- the most promising EV start-up to go public so far -- has quite a bit of potential upside. Once the merger with Churchill Capital IV is completed later this month, the company's stock (which will trade under the  LCID  ticker) should be primed for a nice run as the first examples of the Air begin to reach customers.\u00a0 Rich Smith (EHang Holdings): I'll see your EV companies and raise you... straight up into the air. Competition in the electric car industry is fierce, with everyone from Tesla to NIO to General Motors trying to get a piece of the pie, and that fact creates the risk that while some companies may win in this industry, others are certain to lose. In contrast, an offshoot from the idea of electric cars that's recently been gaining traction is the idea of flying electric cars, also known as air taxis. And this is an industry where there's still very little competition to worry about. The leading pioneer in this new industry is China's EHang Holdings. It's been barely six months since we first started hearing about EHang, but already, the company is making a name for itself. In January, EHang held a demonstration in which a fleet of its EH216 autonomous aerial vehicles (i.e., pilotless, electrically powered, flying air taxis) carried 36 passengers on sightseeing trips in Guangdong, China. Sales in China have already begun, with 22 units sold last quarter. Last week, the company began laying the groundwork for taking its business international, announcing that it has begun conducting trial flights in Japan, preparatory to entering that market. \u00a0 Competition to EHang, meanwhile, is just getting started, with Brazil's Embraer announcing a partnership to manufacture air taxis of its own just last week. But while Embraer's first air taxis won't be ready for delivery before 2026, EHang says it is aiming to sell 250 units this year alone. What's more, EHang announced last month that it's already working on its first upgrade -- a  VT-30  long-range (inter-city) air taxi, with a flight range of 180 miles. \u00a0 Analysts think EHang could book its first full-year profit as soon as this year -- then nearly triple that profit to $0.66 per share in 2022. While EHang stock isn't cheap at a valuation of 63 times sales, it's certainly doing its best to grow into that valuation -- and if it keeps the growth up, I think it could thrive over the long term.

If you're not familiar with Coupang it's because you haven't taken the time to get to know the Amazon of South Korea. Coupang has 16 million active shoppers on its platform, a pretty big deal since that represents roughly a third of the country's adult population. Coupang hit the market at $35 three months ago, quickly topping out at $69 before giving most of that back now.\u00a0 Growth is on a tear. Revenue soared 55% in 2019, picking up the pace with a 91% burst last year. Net revenue climbed 74% (63% on a constant currency basis) in the first quarter of this year. The reason why Coupang is so attractive is because it's going to be hard for anyone -- yes, even Amazon -- to compete. Coupang has already ripped pages out of the leading online e-tailer's playbook. It has a network of 100 fulfillment centers to the point where it's just seven miles or less from 70% of everyone in South Korea. If you want groceries delivered, just place your order on Coupang before midnight. It'll be waiting by your front door before you wake up the next morning. Coupang even excels at restaurant takeout delivery, a platform that even Amazon couldn't make work.\u00a0 Every automaker that matters is making electric vehicles a priority. The always polarizing Tesla is already there. Tesla sold roughly half a million cars last year, no small feat in a pandemic when our vehicles were parked in the garage and new car sales languished. It's going to naturally sell even more in 2021. Tesla has some big first-mover advantages. It has 25,000 Tesla-dedicated Supercharger stations already installed, a moat that finds everyone else leaning on third-party charging stations that will never be proprietary or as reliable. Tesla's leading edge in self-driving technology will also make it hard to catch.\u00a0 Other car makers will copy Tesla's high-margin business model of over-the-air software for premium upgrades. Those that succeed will be taking market share from their legacy gas guzzlers, but not Tesla's promising growth trajectory. A lot of people are betting against Tesla these days, but that also happens to be a\u00a0bullish case for Tesla the next time the stock takes a hit. Like Coupang, Bumble is another 2021 IPO that has come down after its initial pop. It's not a broken IPO. Like Coupang, it's trading just above its debut price -- which in this case was $43 a share for its February IPO. There's a lot to like when it comes to Bumble. It operates the second- and fourth-highest grossing online dating apps in the world. The namesake app that makes up 66% of the revenue mix is growing faster than Tinder, the only online dating application that rakes in more money than Bumble. Revenue growth slowed to 19% last year, but give it a break. We were in a pandemic, and dating was pretty dangerous through most of 2020. The pick-up business is picking up now, with Bumble's revenue up 43% in this year's first quarter.\u00a0 The best is yet to come for Coupang, Tesla Motors, and Bumble. These are three growth stocks that I think you could consider buying the next time the market crashes.

Despite some big slumps in that period, it has been a fantastic ride for well-diversified investors who've been in the market since 2016. Some individual stocks performed far better, though, and delivered life-changing returns for people who simply held on to shares. Let's look at why Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Wayfair (NYSE:W) each trounced the market in the past few years. Image source: Getty Images. Crocs' weak stock price in 2016 was no fluke. The resin footwear specialist was in the middle of a three-year sales slump that had sent shares below $10. The business was struggling to find the right channels to market its products, and it wasn't consistently releasing hit footwear either. But things have changed. In 2020 Crocs reported an impressive 13% sales increase to $1.4 billion (annual revenue was $1 billion in 2017). The company generated plenty of profits from those sales, too. Gross profit margin surged to 56% of sales for its molded products, far higher than Nike's 45%.  CROX Gross Profit Margin data by YCharts The good times kept rolling into early 2021, when Crocs reported big gains in sales, profitability, cash flow, and earnings. Executives are betting that the global growth story is only starting, especially in China. Crocs may have a big opportunity expanding beyond its signature clogs, too, into areas like sandals. Keep an eye on this colorful stock. Five years ago, Tesla was putting the finishing touches on the Model 3, its important step into the mass market of electric vehicles. Despite encouraging early signs of demand, investors faced a staggering list of questions around whether the company could produce quality cars at high volumes, service them efficiently, and maintain a recharging infrastructure that worked for drivers. Fast forward to today, and most of those concerns have been left in the dust. Tesla produced and delivered 500,000 vehicles in 2020. Annual revenue was over $30 billion, compared to just $11.8 billion in 2017. A Tesla investment today still promises significant volatility thanks to its high valuation and CEO Elon Musk's unorthodox approach to capital allocation. But most shareholders are happy to endure those swings in the hopes of watching the business build a massive global sales base while disrupting the wider automobile and home electricity markets. As a leading online retailer of home furnishings, Wayfair was ideally positioned for the consumer demand shifts that marked 2020. Sales rose by $5 billion, or 55%, last year. That's just part of the story for this impressive stock, though. Wayfair also swung to profitability for the first time following a new emphasis on cost cuts by CEO Niraj Shah and his team. The company is expecting to stay in the black long after the pandemic-related growth lift fades, too. In the meantime, encouraging growth metrics like shopper engagement, repeat order volume, and gross profit margin all imply that Wayfair has unique competitive advantages in the attractive home furnishings niche. It owns its fulfillment platform, for example, controls a huge portfolio of brands, and maintains a strong connection to over 30 million active customers. These assets should serve the company well as it pushes into new categories like home improvement and enters additional international markets. Wayfair's best days, like Tesla's and Crocs', appear to be ahead of it.

That's created a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity in the industry that extends from electrical power generation to electric vehicles and energy storage.\u00a0 As we look at opportunities with decades of potential growth, three of our contributors identified\u00a0General Motors (NYSE:GM), Lucid Motors through Churchill Capital Corp IV (NYSE:CCIV), and NIO (NYSE:NIO) as renewable energy stocks that could crush the market. They're not traditional renewable energy stocks, but they are bringing a lot of disruption to the energy industry long term.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Travis Hoium (General Motors): Renewable energy comes in a lot of forms and doesn't have to be just about wind and solar replacing energy sources like coal and natural gas. A large portion of the energy we consume is in the form of oil in vehicles. Making the transition to electric vehicles in the mass market is critical to using more renewable energy, and General Motors will be a key to mass-market EVs.\u00a0 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gets most of the attention in the EV market, but GM is investing $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicle product development between 2020 and 2025 and expects to deliver 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025. The company has already announced the Chevy Bolt, Cadillac LYRIQ, GMC Hummer EV, and an upcoming Silverado electric pickup, but that's likely just the start. Forty percent of models are expected to be electric by 2025 and management thinks the entire fleet could be electric by 2035.\u00a0 The impact on energy could be enormous. Replacing a gasoline-powered engine with electricity allows users to power their vehicles with wind or solar if they've chosen that form of electricity generation. EV charging networks could be powered entirely by renewables. And EV owners are more likely to also have a solar system on their roof, increasing the odds of onsite renewable energy production.\u00a0 To take GM's renewable energy shift to the next level, the company's Cruise subsidiary has committed to using  100% renewable energy  for its electric-powered Origin autonomous ride-sharing vehicle. I think Cruise could ultimately be the\u00a0biggest asset in GM's portfolio, and if it disrupts vehicle ownership and is run on renewable energy it could make GM one of the biggest reasons the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy is possible.\u00a0 Daniel Foelber\u00a0(Lucid Motors): Lucid Motors, which plans to raise $4.6 billion when it merges with a SPAC called Churchill Capital IV, has seen its shares climb upwards of 35% over the last month.\u00a0The company plans to begin delivering its highly anticipated luxury sedan, the Lucid Air Dream Edition, in the second half of this year. With a price tag of $169,000 before federal tax credits, the Dream Edition is by no means cheap. But Lucid plans to phase in three additional trims of the Air between now and 2023. The lowest-priced trim, the Lucid Air Pure, would start at a sticker price below $70,000, assuming a federal tax credit of $7,500.\u00a0 Tapping into the ultra-competitive luxury car market is usually ill-advised. But in Lucid's case, the company has legitimate advantages that give it an edge over rivals like Tesla. With a management team that's a cross between Silicon Valley, legacy automaker, and ex-Tesla employees, Lucid is chock-full of top tier talent. It has spent the last five years designing its own technology and plans to build it all in-house at its production plant in Casa Grande, Arizona. Lucid's Dream Edition has a projected EPA-rated range of 503 miles and 1,080 horsepower, which would make it the first EV to exceed the coveted 500-mile threshold. Its bidirectional 900-volt architecture lets it charge up to 300 miles in less than 20 minutes, as well as power a home if needed. The company's fully integrated powertrain with a smaller, lower-cost battery pack makes it one of the most efficient EVs in terms of miles per kWh.\u00a0 The company sees the global luxury car market growing from just under $500 billion in 2018 to upwards of $730 billion by 2026, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 5%.\u00a0But Lucid thinks it will be able to grow much faster than that. It expects to deliver 20,000 vehicles in 2022, earning $2.2 billion in revenue and $34 million in gross profit. After rolling out more affordable trims of the Lucid Air, it expects 2023 gross profit to exceed $1 billion and revenue to grow at a CAGR of over 59% between 2022 and 2026.\u00a0 Lucid's future hinges on its ability to hit deadlines and maintain a technological edge over the competition. Given that the company is in the early innings of its growth strategy, investors should expect plenty of volatility, as well as adjustments to timelines and performance forecasts. For risk-tolerant investors looking for a growth stock in the burgeoning EV space, Lucid seems to offer one of the best risk-reward profiles out there. Howard Smith (NIO): It's not often that one would designate the stock of a company that almost went out of business as unstoppable. As recently as early 2020, NIO's business flirted with bankruptcy. But a push by the Chinese government to accelerate growth in the country's EV industry contributed to strong sales growth, and investors piled in.\u00a0 The company continues to rapidly grow sales inside China, the largest automotive market globally, and the one with the most potential for EVs. But NIO has also recently announced plans to move into Europe, which is also a huge market. What was once a stock with a market capitalization approaching $100 billion has dropped about 25%. That doesn't make it cheap, but with what looks like a business that can grow for decades, it's one that could justify a higher-risk investment.\u00a0 Interior of NIO ET7 electric luxury sedan. Image source: NIO. Vehicle deliveries increased by 113% in 2020 compared to the prior year. But for the first quarter of 2021, NIO delivered 20,060 vehicles representing an increase of 423% year over year. Like many other automakers, the company's production has recently been hit by the global semiconductor chip shortage. But assuming that will be a short-term impact, there's plenty more to look forward to.\u00a0 NIO announced it will begin production on its first sedan, the luxury ET7, early next year. And the company will begin sales in Europe, starting with Norway, in September 2021. NIO said it will initially sell its flagship ES8 electric SUV in Norway, followed by the new ET7 luxury sedan. And later in 2022, it will install battery swap stations in the country, replicating the network it has in place in China. The charging and battery swap program brings in additional subscription revenue to the company.\u00a0 NIO is adding another manufacturing plant, and its expansion outside of China should continue. With the expected demand for EVs globally, NIO looks to be a long-term growth story that can't be stopped.\u00a0 We've all chosen car companies as our renewable energy stocks that can't be stopped and there's a good reason behind that. The transition to electric vehicles is happening rapidly and GM, Lucid, and NIO are leading the way. That will not only replace gasoline-powered vehicles, but it could also add backup power to homes. EVs and backup power have years and maybe decades of growth ahead and that's why the EV industry is the focus of our picks today.\u00a0  "}, {"source": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Why Ford's Electric F-150 Lightning Is Bullish ", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/12/why-fords-electric-f-150-lightning-is-bullish/", "date": "Sat, 12 Jun 2021 13:33:00 GMT", "content": "Some auto investors were initially unimpressed by\u00a0Ford Motor Company's (NYSE:F) reveal of its battery-electric F-150 Lightning last month. After all, if Ford is simply defending its pickup-truck turf from new entrants as the world transitions to electric vehicles, how could that be bullish?\u00a0 But it turns out that some of the opportunities enabled by the new truck could well be bullish for Ford's sales and profits. In this Motley Fool Live broadcast, recorded on May 27, Industry Focus host Nick Sciple and Motley Fool senior auto specialist John Rosevear take a closer look at how the F-150 Lightning fits into Ford's profit-growth plan -- and why even defending its turf is arguably bullish for Ford's stock right now.\u00a0 A transcript is below.\u00a0   Nick Sciple: You mentioned the new electric truck that Ford revealed, the F-150 Lightning, that's gotten a ton of headlines in the past few weeks. Of course, the F-Series is the highest-selling vehicle in North America. How does the F-150 Lightning plug into the strategy and what do you think about the potential for that vehicle more broadly? John Rosevear: Well, I think the potential is huge, I think the world has been waiting for it. Ford will tell you that, particularly their fleet customers have been waiting for it, that they are under some pressure, regulatory pressure in some states, but also corporate pressures, internal pressures to green up to go to more sustainable solutions, to go to more zero-emission solutions. Again, it fits right in, starting next year, we can ship you electric pickups, zero emissions. They're easy to recharge and has a ton of features where it can charge on AC power so that commercial customers don't have to dig trenches and install new equipment to do DC fast charging and so forth. They can do all of this, they can just plug into their existing systems with some simple electrical upgrades, packet base, or whatever, or the driver can take it home. There are some businesses where the driver takes the truck or the delivery van home at night, they can recharge it. Ford chargers will note how much electricity is going to the truck and then make sure that the driver gets reimbursed for that portion of their electric bill. They've thought this out really thoroughly. For instance, they've spent three years scoping all this and you can really see it, it is huge. There's also a more subtle part to this strategy, which is that Ford knows they can sell this truck right now, certainly when it ships next spring to a lot of its fleet customers. Retail has been a little more of an uncertain thing. We don't know how retail electric vehicle adoption is going. Certainly, early reservations on the F-150 have been very promising. But the more subtle thing is, I think Ford season opportunity, you get people driving the electric transit, the electric F-150 at work, and they come home and say, electric vehicle's really nice, I think it's got a great truck, it's got a great pick-up, it's quiet, everything works really well. Maybe we want one of those, maybe I want one of those as my personal truck. Maybe when friends ask me,  Are these electric vehicles for me?  You can say,  Yeah, I drive one at work, it's great.  There is that word of mouth into audiences that buy a lot of trucks perhaps, that will benefit Ford over time as well. It is a big deal. The F-150 is a huge part of that, but don't sleep on also the electric Transit which is coming later this year, and it is really optimized for fleet buyers. They look at how much range do our customers really need, we'll give them some extra but I forget what it is like 180 miles of range they're putting in the van. The first thing all the Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) fans say,  Haha, that's nothing,  and then Ford says,  Well, if I'd tell you the average van driver in our customer base and we have thousands and thousands of these that we track, drives 125 miles a day, what do they need anymore? They just need to be able to plug it in every night and have it ready to go in the morning. It's a really thoroughly thought out product tools for jobs, and this is all again under the Ford Pro brand subgroup within Ford that Ted Cannis is running. Nick Sciple: One other thing, while we're on the topic of the new F-150 Lightning you mentioned earlier Ford defending its territory against some of these new entrants, Lordstown Motors is one example that's good to come to market. You've had Tesla with their Cybertruck. How do you think about what the competitive landscape is starting to look like in this EV truck market? John Rosevear: On the commercial side, good luck competing with Ford. Unless you're General Motors, good luck competing with Ford. The odds that a commercial fleet buyer is going to take a chance on an untested company, untested product when they know they can get a Ford next spring, I think the bull case for [Lordstown Motors] now has some very big problems because their whole bet is that they could get some share in commercial vehicles, electric pickup trucks specifically before the big guys got there, and now that doesn't look so good. On the retail side, it's a much more interesting picture. That's not where Lordstown is going. It is where Rivian is going at the higher-end. Whether a truck in the 70, $80,000 space, it's a luxury truck. It's a little smaller than an F-150. Their pickup, they also do an SUV on the same architecture, on the same skateboard as we say now. I think the F-150 will challenge them a little bit at the high-end because, of course, as Ford does, the retail truck will come in several different tiers, including a loaded luxury tier that will go up around $90,000 with fancy leather seats and the great stereo and all this stuff. Tesla to me is somewhat of a question mark in the middle there. I look at the Cybertruck and I say that is really not tailored for fleet users. I'm sure somebody will buy 10 of them to deliver pizzas and/or whatever. [laughs] But when you look at the commercial vehicle businesses in North America and Europe, the Cybertruck doesn't fit into there at all. That's a real question mark to me. We talked about a $40,000 price point, that would certainly be lower. But I still think this is a niche product for Tesla fans, rather than something that's going to actually seriously threaten vehicles like the F-150, and like GM's pickups, Stellantis' Ram pickups, and so forth. That's where I'm seeing it right now. We'll find out how this all goes in a year or so that when these trucks actually come to market, something they'll do.

", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/16/bitcoin-crashed-nearly-50-last-weekend-should-you/", "date": "Wed, 16 Jun 2021 17:47:37 GMT", "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) is going through a rough patch as it has plunged nearly 50% since its previous high in April 2021. The flagship cryptocurrency lost $1 trillion in market cap last month, and this downward spiral has a mix of factors at play. In May, Elon Musk's tweet about Tesla not accepting Bitcoins wiped off 10% of its value. Later that month, China's crackdown on cryptocurrencies pushed Bitcoin below $30,000. And the IRS calling for stringent reporting on large crypto transfers added to the woes.\u00a0 So, has the tide turned against Bitcoin permanently? The situation might be rattling for new investors, but if you have traced the journey of Bitcoin, this is nothing new. According to analysts, investors who owned Bitcoin for one to six months spurred the sell-off. Nevertheless, institutional investors, big corporations, and analysts are still pretty confident of Bitcoin's price rebound.\u00a0 Image Source: Getty Images Here are three main reasons to explain that the current Bitcoin crash is nothing to worry about. Institutional investors include large public and private companies as well as fund houses that invest in Bitcoin-related products. Jack Dorsey-led Square invested an additional $170 million in Bitcoin in February 2021. In the same month, Microstrategy spent more than $1 billion in high-yield debt to acquire additional bitcoins. In March 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first big U.S. bank to offer access to Bitcoin funds to its high net worth clients.\u00a0 Institutional investors aren't just hooked on Bitcoin for the price appreciation. They view the currency as a credible store of value and a hedge against economic instability. The continued influx of large corporations can single-handedly push Bitcoin into the mainstream. Bloomberg claims\u00a0rapid bitcoin adoption indicates a bullish growth phase. The media giant also predicted bitcoin's price to reach $400,000 by the end of Q4 2021. Besides institutional investors, many governments are also viewing cryptocurrencies in a new light. El Salvador recently declared Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Speculation is rife that India might also recognize Bitcoin as an asset class. Moreover, the U.S., UK, Finland, Canada, and Germany already have a positive stance over Bitcoin. These initiatives could perpetually alter the way investors and regulators view Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and make them mainstream.\u00a0 50% of Bitcoins were mined by January 2009, but the remaining 50% will be mined in more than 120 years. This is because of a unique event called 'halving' that Bitcoin undergoes every four years. The miners' reward is reduced to half every four years or after mining every 210,000 blocks. Thus, the supply of Bitcoin relative to the demand declines, and the price climbs. Historically, Bitcoin has always experienced an upward spiral after a halving event. After the first halving in 2012, the price of Bitcoin surged 90x.\u00a0 The next event is due in 2024, and we can expect the cryptocurrency to see a bull run after that. However, the market has now matured since 2012, and the impact might not be too pronounced this time. Also, it could take four to six months for the price appreciation to fructify. Hence, you may buy Bitcoin before the halving event, but only if you plan to hold it over the long term.\u00a0 Though the current scenario suggests otherwise, the game is not over for Bitcoin. It has an inherent value, and a few tweets cannot shake it. As for the regulatory landscape, I would say that stricter laws are indeed awaiting the cryptocurrencies. But better regulation will only enhance the credibility and prompt investors to pick Bitcoin with more conviction.\u00a0 Bitcoin price movements are a simple play of supply and demand. Unlike stocks, there aren't any fundamentals at play. So when investors are optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency, they buy more of it, and the price climbs. On the contrary, when their belief in the currency begins to shake, they sell-off. There is no doubt that Bitcoin has come under pressure, and it could take some time to recover due to regulatory headwinds and global macro risk. However, further declines below this point, if any, will be transient.\u00a0 Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and you can hold them as a part of a diversified portfolio over the long term. However, don't be surprised to see such dramatic price fluctuations periodically because that's very typical of cryptocurrencies. So, be sure to invest money only to the extent that you are OK to lose. Also, don't try to time the markets because, with an asset so volatile, timing can bring a rude shock.  "}, {"source": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Why Bitcoin Stocks Like MicroStrategy and Riot Blockchain Were Up This Week ", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-cryptocurrency-stocks-bitcoin-riot-stock-up/", "date": "Thu, 17 Jun 2021 20:38:25 GMT", "content": "The price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) was about $38,400 as of 12:45 p.m. EDT on Thursday, according to CoinDesk -- up sharply from its weekly low of about $35,000 on Sunday.\u00a0There were two big news items for Bitcoin over the past week. The first concerns a social media post by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, which may only be a short-term catalyst. However, the Bitcoin blockchain is also now officially scheduled to receive an important upgrade, which could be a more long-term demand driver. However, it's not as though technology company MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) needed any more reasons to buy Bitcoin. The company is already taking on as much debt as it can to buy more and more bitcoins, as we'll see in a minute. And considering how much it owns, it's not surprising to see its stock rise with the price of Bitcoin in recent days. So far for the week, MicroStrategy stock is up 21%. And with the price of Bitcoin rising, stocks that benefit from mining are also up for the week. As of this writing, Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) stock was up 13%, Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN) was up 8%, CleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) was up 9%, and Ebang International Holdings (NASDAQ:EBON) was up 13%. Image source: Getty Images. First the short-term catalyst for Bitcoin: On June 13, Musk said Tesla would start allowing Bitcoin as a method of payment again on two conditions.\u00a0First, he wants to be sure at least 50% of the energy used to run the Bitcoin blockchain network is coming from clean energy sources. Second, he also wants to see Bitcoin trending in a greener direction. While Bitcoin popped around the time of Musk's comments, it's important to note that most people aren't using Bitcoin to pay for things like they would with fiat currency. In part, this is because cryptocurrency investors believe Bitcoin will increase in value over time. Therefore, it doesn't make much sense to spend it. That's why I see Musk's support as a short-term boost for Bitcoin. But what if people did want to digitally transact more with Bitcoin in the future? That could be a problem. You see, right now Bitcoin is limited with how much volume it can handle, and normal payment volume for an entire economy would be too much. This is due to how information is processed and recorded on the blockchain.\u00a0 On June 12, Bitcoin developers and miners took a big step forward in addressing this scalability problem.\u00a0Developers have come up with a package of upgrades for the Bitcoin blockchain called Taproot. But developers only propose ideas -- miners have to signal support for the proposals by putting a marker on the blocks they process. Once enough miners have  voted  in favor of changes, the blockchain network is ready for the upgrade. And on Saturday, over 90% of miners had signaled support for Taproot, the support level needed to make it happen. According to many developers, the Taproot update should go into effect for Bitcoin in November. Important changes include the ability for speedier transaction processing -- basically the data on the blockchain should get smaller, making it speedier and less energy intensive. But also, Taproot will allow developers to build onto the Bitcoin blockchain like they already can on blockchains like Ethereum, which could be a game-changing update. Image source: Getty Images. Taproot will give Bitcoin new use cases that could drive greater demand and send prices higher. And without a doubt, that's something MicroStrategy shareholders are hoping for. The company currently holds over 92,000 bitcoins and on June 14 it issued $500 million more in convertible senior notes to buy even more Bitcoin. This management team is clearly betting the farm that Bitcoin will go up. And MicroStrategy could be in a tough place financially if that doesn't pan out. The ripple effect that Taproot could have for Bitcoin miners is unclear right now. We often discuss how miners are rewarded with 6.25 bitcoins for every block they mine -- this is one way companies like Riot Blockchain and CleanSpark make money. But miners also make money from transaction fees, which have spiked significantly higher over the past year.  Bitcoin Average Transaction Fee data by YCharts Transaction fees have fallen sharply in recent weeks but are still historically high at over $6 per transaction. If Taproot speeds things up, fees could plummet even further, resulting in less revenue for some of these mining companies. That said, it's all relative since they're paid in Bitcoin, not dollars. Simply put, there's a lot of variables in play making it hard to predict what revenue will look like for these companies. What's more certain is Bitcoin miners continuing to increase their computing power, creating a booming business opportunity for Canaan and Ebang. These two companies manufacture equipment for mining cryptocurrencies. But just because miners are purchasing a lot of equipment right now doesn't mean investors interested in this space can be indiscriminate in what stocks they buy. For example, Canaan continues to update shareholders about the new orders it's receiving. On June 16, the company announced it had just received a new order for 10,000 mining machines from Genesis Digital Assets. It's just one of several deals Canaan has announced in recent weeks. By contrast, Ebang's revenue fell 83% year over year in 2020 as management noted weak demand for its mining machines -- for perspective, that's not much worse than Canaan's 69% decline in 2020 revenue.

The rise of the company since 2015 has been nothing but remarkable, mostly thanks to its CEO Lisa Su. AMD has seen its market value surge to more than $90 billion from about $2 billion since she took over, and recently it announced a $4 billion stock repurchase plan. But can things be too good to be true? Can AMD continue to grow?\u00a0 Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) struggle is one factor behind AMD's success. Intel is still struggling with manufacturing after years of delays for its 10-nanometer chips. AMD uses TSMC (NYSE:TSM) to build its latest Ryzen and EPYC chips, giving it access to cutting-edge manufacturing processes. AMD provides chips for the latest PlayStation and Xbox game consoles as well as Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) in-car gaming rig. Strong demand for those consoles has boosted AMD's results. AMD's revenue soared 93% in the first quarter, and net income more than tripled.\u00a0 Back in 2006, AMD reached 20% market share and that's as high as it got for the company. Back then it was Intel who was the one stealing AMD's lunch. Will history repeat itself? Back in February, it was reported that Intel got some market share back for the first time in three years. AMD no longer manufactures its own chips, so the company doesn't have to pour cash into keeping up with Intel on the manufacturing side. But that would mean that AMD is entirely dependent on securing capacity at third-party foundries such as TSMC. Intel recently announced a $20 billion factory expansion in Arizona where it will be offering contract manufacturing jobs, and this will become a core part of the business. Could AMD turn into Intel's client? Only time will tell but as of now, AMD's future looks bright -- but expect Intel to give it a run for its money.\u00a0 Watch the video below for the full insights. *Stock prices used were the closing prices of June 14, 2021.

The cryptocurrency is obviously rising in prominence, which bodes well for the bull case for the asset, which some investors believe will eventually replace fiat (or government-issued) currency. Because of these factors (and others), Bitcoin has easily outpaced the performance of the broader market year to date. However, some stocks have performed significantly better than the digital coin. Two such stocks are Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN) and Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX). Are these high-flying biotech stocks buys?  Bitcoin Price data by YCharts Ocugen is hoping to make a name for itself by entering the COVID-19 vaccine market. The company is developing Covaxin, a potential vaccine for the disease, in collaboration with India-based Bharat Biotech. Bharat is running a phase 3 study in India for this candidate, and according to interim results released by the two partners back in March, Covaxin proved 81% effective at preventing COVID-19. What's more, there is evidence that it is also effective against newer variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease, particularly those that emerged in the U.K. and Brazil. Based on these results, Ocugen had planned to apply for emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Covaxin. Importantly, the company will have the right to commercialize the vaccine in the U.S. and Canada if it is approved. Ocugen is set to keep only 45% of the profits Covaxin will generate in these countries. However, the biotech's plan to request an EUA hit a major roadblock. On June 10, the company announced that under the recommendation of the FDA, it will now pursue a Biologics License Application (BLA) for Covaxin. Image source: Getty Images. This change matters for one simple reason. An EUA would take only a few weeks (at most) to get approved, whereas a BLA typically takes at least six months and can take up to 10. In other words, Covaxin won't hit the U.S. market anytime soon, which is awful news for Ocugen and its shareholders. It is no surprise that the company's stock plunged on the news. But there is more. The FDA also requested additional information and data to support the company's BLA for Covaxin, which means even the six- to 10-month timeline to bring Covaxin to market seems optimistic at the moment. By the time Ocugen's candidate finally earns FDA approval, COVID-19 vaccines will likely be commonplace. And whatever profit the company will generate from it in the U.S. and Canada, Ocugen won't even retain half of it. Further, the rest of the company's pipeline is thin, and none of its other candidates are even close to reaching late-stage clinical trials.\u00a0For those reasons, investors would do well to stay a safe distance away from this biotech stock.\u00a0 Novavax is also developing a coronavirus vaccine candidate, one by the name of NVX-CoV2373. And although the company has yet to earn an EUA for its potential vaccine, there are a few things to consider. First, the biotech initiated rolling reviews for its candidate in several countries, including Canada and the European Union. The company expects to file for an EUA in both the U.K. and the U.S. in the third quarter of its fiscal year 2021. Second, Novavax's vaccine was highly effective in a phase 3 clinical trial conducted in the U.K., with an overall efficacy of 90%; it proved 100% effective against moderate and severe cases of the disease. NVX-CoV2373 also seems potent against severe cases of the disease caused by the newer variants of the virus, such as those that have emerged in the U.K. and South Africa. Third, Novavax has already signed agreements with several governments worldwide to supply more than 300 million vaccine doses. Even if the company is late to the market, it will generate at least modest revenue from NVX-CoV2373. Novavax does have other things going its way; two in particular deserve mention. On April 23, the biotech announced that data from a phase 2b clinical trial for a malaria vaccine called R21 was published in Preprints with The Lancet, an online journal that publishes non-peer-reviewed medical research. R21 was developed by the University of Oxford and is licensed to Serum Institute of India, but Novavax's Matrix-M adjuvant helped boost its efficacy.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. During the trial, the vaccine was 77% effective in the higher adjuvant dose group and 71% effective in the lower adjuvant group. The University of Oxford has already started recruiting participants for a phase 3 study. If this vaccine earns regulatory approval, Novavax will hold the right to commercialize the vaccine in certain countries. Then there's the company's NanoFlu, a potential flu vaccine for adults aged 65 and older. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 70% and 85% of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in patients 65 years and older in recent years. There is still a dire need for a vaccine that addresses this problem. In a phase 3 clinical trial, NanoFlu demonstrated non-inferior immunogenicity (the ability to trigger an immune response in the body) compared to Fluzone, the leading flu vaccine for seniors on the market.\u00a0NanoFlu is likely to go on to earn regulatory approval, making it another long-term opportunity for Novavax. But the company has yet to file for FDA approval for this candidate, much to the dismay of investors. Still, in my view, the company's late-stage pipeline (NanoFlu and NVX-VoV2373) could reach combined annual worldwide sales of several hundred million dollars. For a company that currently has no products on the market, this bodes well for its future. That's why I think Novavax is worth serious consideration, especially for those investors willing to be patient.\u00a0  "}, {"source": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Why Zscaler Is A Great Investment Amid Rising Cybersecurity Threats ", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/12/why-zscaler-is-a-great-investment-amid-rising-cybe/", "date": "Sat, 12 Jun 2021 10:18:00 GMT", "content": "Cybersecurity has dominated the headlines recently, as foreign and domestic hackers target critical U.S. industries and infrastructure seeking ransom payments. Damage caused by cybercrime is expected to cost up to $6 trillion globally in 2021 according to Cybersecurity Ventures, so companies can't afford to skimp on protection. As more networks migrate to the cloud, over 450 of the Forbes global 2,000 companies have sought assistance from Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS).\u00a0 The company offers a wide range of products and services to make cloud operations safe and secure. Although it's still operating at a loss, the business is scaling quickly, gearing its additional investments toward bolstering its presence in ransomware. Cybercrime is only growing more dangerous, so Zscaler shares might be a good place for your money going forward.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Zscaler takes a cloud-based approach to cybersecurity. This is designed to protect company networks and assets, even when employees are accessing them remotely, for example. Put simply, Zscaler acts as a filter between a device and the internet to protect against cyber threats on the way to accessing assets online. Since it is cloud-based, it doesn't require any additional hardware or software installed on devices, or on-premises.\u00a0 The company also offers a private access solution (ZPA), designed to build a secure perimeter around an entity's applications. Since connectivity is increasingly moving away from company networks and onto the internet, it's important to implement security where those connections happen. Zscaler Private Access works on zero-trust network access, where every user needs to adhere to strict identification requirements -- whether they're a part of the network or not. This makes the applications behind the protective layer virtually invisible to outsiders, because they're never directly exposed to the internet.\u00a0 Zscaler is also an authorized networking partner for Microsoft Office 365. In an age where collaborative live documents have changed the way we work, it's as important as ever to focus on protecting the data contained in those shared files. Over 4,500 companies have used Zscaler to deploy Office 365. For the fiscal 2021 third quarter, which was just announced, Zscaler generated $176.4 million in revenue, up 60% year over year. However, the company's net loss more than tripled to $58.4 million -- attributable to more aggressive spending on marketing, research and development, and interest payments on debt. The loss was a reduction on a sequential basis, though.\u00a0 Zscaler is a software-as-a-service company with high gross margins, so in theory it has the flexibility to run high costs to grow its business, and cut them back in the future to generate net profits.\u00a0 Metric Fiscal Q4 2020 Fiscal Q1 2021 Fiscal Q2 2021 Fiscal Q3 2021 Revenue (millions) $125.9 $142.6 $157.0 $176.4 Deferred Revenue* (millions) $369.8 $371.9 $446.8 $495.4 GAAP Net Loss $49.5 $55.0 $67.5 $58.4 DATA SOURCE: COMPANY FILINGS. *DEFERRED REVENUE RELATES TO ADVANCED PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE. GAAP = generally accepted accounting principles. Overall, the company is doing a good job managing its losses as revenue ramps up, even with the key acquisitions of small cloud start-ups TrustDome and Smokescreen Technologies.\u00a0Zscaler will continue to invest in developing these new technologies, with the goal of integrating them into its main products and services to bolster future revenue growth.\u00a0 With $601.9 million in trailing 12-month revenue and a market capitalization of $25 billion, its revenue multiple is about 43 times. While this is extremely high -- even higher than high-flyer Tesla, for example -- at the current rate of growth, the stock could begin to look cheap within a couple of years. Not to mention, Zscaler's stock is down about 13% from its highs, and if it continues to dive, it will bring down that lofty revenue multiple even further.\u00a0 The company has a clear focus on growth instead of profitability in the short term, as it outlined in the recent Q3 earnings call. This might cause persistent losses for now, but could be key to big earnings results in the future.\u00a0 The global cybersecurity industry was about $162 billion in size in 2020, and is expected to grow to $418 billion by 2028 -- so Zscaler has a significant market opportunity. As cybercrime continues to cause a growing amount of damage, this estimate might even be conservative.\u00a0 However, there is a lot of competition in this space. Zscaler has some advantages, in that it's already acquired highly valuable customers that will likely be reluctant to switch providers (big companies find major systems changes burdensome). It also has a very non-invasive product that doesn't require large-scale installations across company networks or devices, which makes the user experience rather seamless. Finally, Zscaler is already recognized as the leader in this space -- so it's in a strong position to advance its business.  With over $1.4 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments, Zscaler is well capitalized to continue investing in growth. Investors should watch for revenue performance in the coming quarters, to see if the company can keep up its current pace.

If so, you're in good company. Not only are a lot of people into it, but a bunch of big-name investors also see a bright future for digital money. Not that you should dive in simply because they have, but here's a closer look at five of the crypto market's biggest supporters...and not just with lip service. You might know him as the guy who made a fortune back in 1987 when he correctly predicted that year's Black Monday crash and then made the right bets accordingly. But Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, wasn't just lucky. He's continued to prove he has an eye for what's on the horizon, and is particularly savvy when it comes to currency trading. To this end, while it's unlikely that Jones envisioned anything remotely like Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) or Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) back in 1987, he's clearly bullish on the idea. In a recent interview with CNBC, the financial guru said:  I like the idea of investing in something that's reliable, consistent, honest, and 100% certain. So, Bitcoin has appealed to me because it's a way for me to invest in certainty.  He's not just an actor and an activist. Ashton Kutcher is also a serious investor, co-founding venture capital firms A-Grade Investments in 2010 and then Sound Ventures in 2015. He was also an early investor in Uber Technologies\u00a0and Airbnb, just to name a couple. He's a big Bitcoin fan, too, although his most noteworthy play in the cryptocurrency arena is/was a lower-profile digital currency called UnikoinGold. Meant to be a means of betting on e-sports events, UnikoinGold has since been shut down by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nevertheless, Kutcher's interest in an off-the-beaten-path play like this underscores just how wide his field of future-minded vision is. Cathie Wood doesn't need much in the way of an introduction. She's been in the investment business for more than 40 years, and has seen dramatic growth in her fame since founding ARK Investment Management back in 2014. Of course, much of that fame is a result of ARK's focus. All of the firm's funds aim to hold stocks and investments that are on the leading edge of  disruptive innovation,  which includes cryptocurrencies. In addition to outright ownership of various cryptos, ARK's funds also hold stakes in companies like Square\u00a0and Coinbase Global that are helping to normalize the use of these alternative currencies. Image source: Getty Images. Not only does Wood anticipate the eventual creation of a pure-play Bitcoin ETF, but the investing industry veteran also believes the cryptocurrency could eventually reach a price of $500,000 -- more than 10 times its current value. He may not be as well known as Cathie Wood or Ashton Kutcher, but Barry Silbert is a name worth knowing. He is worth around $1.5 billion, and much of that wealth is the result of his investments in cryptocurrencies and the companies making them possible. Silbert is the founder of Digital Currency Group, which owns a slew of smaller and privately held outfits like blockchain registry company Bitmark, crypto-exchange support player Coinflex, and payments platforms such as Bitwala, just to name a few. All told, Digital Currency Group holds more than 100 crypto-related companies, most of which you probably haven't heard of. Finally, the founder of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) didn't start out as a huge fan of cryptocurrencies; he mostly evolved into one. Regardless, his support for Bitcoin, Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE), and others is clear. He didn't merely tweet about Bitcoin in January and then talk up (and then talk down) Dogecoin when hosting Saturday Night Live last month. Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency in February, and briefly accepted Bitcoin as a means of paying for its electric automobiles. The company discontinued this form of payment last month, but not because Musk lost faith in the idea. Tesla intends to reinstate its acceptance of Bitcoin for its cars once Bitcoin miners are powering their operations with more environmentally friendly electricity.

Bonds and commodities may have their time in the spotlight, but they all significantly lag the stock market in average annual return over the very long term. However, the stock market's supremacy as one of the world's greatest wealth creators has been called into question in recent years by cryptocurrencies. In a little over a decade, the world's largest digital currency, Bitcoin, has rocketed from around $1 per token to as high as $64,000. But it's not Bitcoin that has retail investors fascinated in 2021. Rather, it's the so-called  people's currency,  Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE). The Shiba Inu dog breed was the inspiration behind joke-based crypto Dogecoin. Image source: Getty Images. The buzz surrounding Dogecoin has to do with a combination of its insane momentum (it gained as much as 27,000% on a trailing six-month basis), growing support from Tesla\u00a0CEO Elon Musk, and the perception that it's being adopted on a regular basis in the real world. Unfortunately, if prospective investors were to do any digging, they'd find that the claims made by Dogecoin bulls are often exaggerated or fail to tell the full story. Working backwards, Dogecoin has very little real-world use. Online business-directory Cryptwerk lists approximately 1,400 businesses worldwide that accept Dogecoin as payment. Keep in mind that it's taken eight years simply to reach this really low figure. To boot, Dogecoin's blockchain isn't handling all that many transactions on a daily basis. Data from BitInfoCharts.com shows that roughly 50,000 transactions occur each day on its blockchain. For comparative purposes, payment-processing kingpins Visa\u00a0and Mastercard\u00a0handled a combined 700 million payments daily in 2018, according to the Nilson report. It would take close to four decades for Dogecoin to do what these payment giants do daily. The hype surrounding Elon Musk also lacks substance. Tweeting about Dogecoin has no tangible impact on blockchain performance and shouldn't send its market value soaring 30%. What it does demonstrate is that Dogecoin's investors are driven purely by hype and, in many instances, misinformation. From its transaction fees and settlement times to its virtual lack of real-world use, Dogecoin is wholly unimpressive and a direct representation of what a pump-and-dump scheme looks like. If you want to watch an investment of yours  go to the moon,  Dogecoin isn't where you want to put your money to work. Instead, you should focus on stocks with tangible long-term growth potential. The following trio of growth stocks all look ready to blast off and head significantly higher. Image source: Getty Images. If you want a high-growth stock with a genuine chance to shoot higher, consider buying telemedicine-giant Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC). Shares of the company are up tenfold in five years, and I believe they could jump another tenfold before the decade is over. As you can probably imagine, Teladoc was one of the biggest direct beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic. Physicians did everything possible to keep high-risk patients and those who might potentially be infected out of their offices. This meant turning to virtual platforms. In 2020, Teladoc handled 10.59 million virtual visits, which more than doubled the 4.14 million it handled in the previous year. But you should understand that this is far more than a pandemic play. Annual revenue growth for Teladoc averaged 74% in the six years preceding the pandemic. This isn't a fluke -- it's a clear sign that telehealth is adding value to the healthcare-treatment chain. Virtual visits are considerably more convenient for patients and allow physicians to better keep up with chronically ill patients. The latter can result in improved patient outcomes, which health insurers are bound to appreciate. It also doesn't hurt that virtual visits are billed at a lower rate than office visits. Aside from this push to greater telehealth usage, Teladoc further differentiated itself by acquiring Livongo Health in the fourth quarter. Livongo is a leading applied health signals company that uses artificial intelligence to send tips to its chronically ill members to help them lead healthier lives. It was profitable prior to being acquired by Teladoc and has since grown its chronic member count to almost 660,000.\u00a0 With the addition of Livongo, Teladoc Health might be the most innovative precision-medicine company in the entire healthcare sector. Image source: Getty Images. Forget the buzz surrounding Dogecoin -- you'll find a more profitable buzz from U.S. marijuana stocks, such as multistate operator (MSO) Jushi Holdings (OTC:JUSHF). To tackle the obvious question, U.S. MSOs may be nominally pricier than Canadian pot stocks, but there's good reason for that. The U.S. weed market is expected to grow by 21% annually through mid-decade, ultimately hitting $41.5 billion in annual sales by 2025, per New Frontier Data. Meanwhile, Canada has been bogged down by regulatory issues and pot stock overzealousness. Countrywide sales for our northerly neighbor could be an eighth the size of the U.S. market by mid-decade. With that out of the way, we can focus on what makes Jushi so unique: its three-state focus. Most of Jushi's sales are expected to come from Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Virginia. All three of these states are limited-license markets. In Pennsylvania and Illinois, only a preset number of dispensary licenses can be issued. As for Virginia, retail licenses are awarded by jurisdiction. The point is that Jushi is going to be able to build up its brand and create a loyal following without much competition. Jushi has also been willing to pull the trigger on acquisitions to expand its reach. Since the year began, it's expanded its retail and/or cultivation presence in Pennsylvania and Virginia, and it's picked up dispensaries in California, the largest marijuana market in the world by annual sales. Jushi currently has 20 operating dispensaries but is on track to potentially finish 2021 with closer to 30 open retail stores.\u00a0 Best of all, Jushi is dirt cheap by U.S. MSO standards. It's valued at roughly 2.5 times forward-year sales in an industry where most cannabis MSOs go for a multiple of five (or more) times their forward-year sales. Its moon shot is coming. Image source: Getty Images. A third growth stock readying to blast off that should be able to run circles around Dogecoin is companion-animal health insurance company Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP). If you need any convincing that the pet industry is a smart place to put your money to work, just turn to data from the American Pet Products Association. In a 32-year stretch between 1988 and 2020, the percentage of U.S. households that owned a pet rose from 56% to 67%. Further, there hasn't been a year-over-year decline in U.S. pet expenditures dating back to at least 1994. Since cats and dogs are viewed as members of the family by virtually all pet owners, they'll spend big bucks to ensure their well-being. That's where Trupanion fits in. For the past two decades, Trupanion has been providing health insurance for companion animals. The company ended the first quarter of 2021 with almost 944,000 enrolled pets, and many of them are on recurring monthly subscriptions. The crazy thing is that this 944,000 figure represents only around 1% of all companion animals in the United States. If closer to one-quarter of all U.S. households had pet insurance on their dog or cat, Trupanion's addressable market would be approaching $33 billion.\u00a0 If you're concerned about competition in the companion-animal space, you shouldn't be. Trupanion has spent two decades forging partnerships at the clinical level. It's also the only major pet insurer with software capable of handling payment at the time of checkout. These tangible and intangible advantages should allow the company to handily surpass 1 million enrolled pets as soon as the June-ended quarter. Companion animal health insurance is a nascent but fast-growing industry that can make investors rich.

Over the past four decades, the benchmark S&P 500 has navigated its way through Black Monday in 1987, the dot-com bubble, the Great Recession, and more recently the coronavirus crash. Despite these drawn out and in some cases abrupt swoons, the average annual total return of the S&P 500, including dividends paid, is 11% over four decades. However, this long-term buy-and-hold thesis has been put to the test in recent years by the rise of cryptocurrencies. In particular, there's an immense amount of buzz surrounding meme-based digital currency Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE), which has risen by more than 100,000% since December 2013. Image source: Getty Images. The so-called  people's currency  is lauded for its nominally low price point of $0.32 per token, as well as the perception that current investors are getting in near the ground floor, well before broad-based adoption. Enthusiasts also point to Tesla\u00a0CEO Elon Musk's unwavering support of Dogecoin as a positive. While these catalysts might sound great on paper, they're often lacking in a big way if you dig below the surface-scratching social media hype. For example, coin price isn't everything. Dogecoin might sound nominally inexpensive at $0.32, but it overlooks that practically 130 billion tokens are outstanding. This circulating supply is growing by approximately 5.2 billion tokens each year. This constant mining-based inflation modestly dilutes existing Dogecoin holders. A much bigger issue can be seen on the utility front. Enthusiasts would like to believe they're getting in on the ground floor, but only an estimated 1,400 businesses are accepting Dogecoin worldwide, according to online business director Cryptwerk. Worse yet, it's taken eight years simply to reach a meager 1,400 businesses. Dogecoin's blockchain isn't particularly efficient, either. While it does boast lower transaction fees than the Big Two of crypto (Bitcoin\u00a0and Ethereum), there are a number of other crypto competitors that offer considerably lower transaction fees. Dogecoin also takes around 20 minutes to validate and settle transactions, which is longer than other popular cryptos. It could also be argued that Elon Musk is more of a liability than a positive catalyst. Musk's about-face on Bitcoin should serve as a warning for Dogecoin enthusiasts. The simple fact that a meme tweeted out by Musk can move Dogecoin by 30% or more is a pretty clear indication that hype, not tangible catalysts, are driving this bus. The thing about hype train is that is always eventually derails. Instead of putting your money to work in a highly speculative digital currency with virtually no real-world catalysts, my suggestion would be to buy stocks that offer tangible long-term growth potential. The following trio of top-notch stocks could all make you a boatload of money. Image source: Getty Images. Just as you shouldn't let Dogecoin's nominally low token price fool you into thinking it's in any way cheap, you shouldn't allow robotic-assisted surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ:ISRG) $864 share price convince you that it's pricey. Over time, Intuitive Surgical has all the tools (literally and metaphorically speaking) to make its shareholders rich. Intuitive Surgical has been manufacturing and selling its da Vinci surgical system to hospitals and surgical centers for two decades. These systems allow for more precise incisions, compared to laparoscopic surgery, which can in turn lead to shorter hospital stays and fewer complications. Since 2000, more than 6,100 da Vinci systems have been installed worldwide, which is far more than any of its competitors on a combined basis. This suggests Intuitive Surgical's market share dominance in robotic-assisted surgery is likely insurmountable. What's more, Intuitive Surgical's operating model is built in such a way that operating margins improve over time, which should lead to earnings growth outpacing sales growth throughout this decade. In its early years, selling its pricey da Vinci system made up the bulk of its revenue. But given that these systems are intricate and complex, the margins associated with selling these systems wasn't great. Nowadays, the bulk of the company's revenue comes from selling instruments and accessories with each procedure, as well as from servicing its da Vinci systems. These are considerably higher-margin operating segments. As the base of installed da Vinci surgical systems grows, the percentage of revenue derived from these higher-margin channels increases, too. There's also plenty of opportunity for the company to expand its surgical focus. Da Vinci is a mainstay in urology and gynecology procedures, but can still gain abundant share in thoracic, colorectal, and general soft tissue procedures. For all of these reasons, it's a company that can maintain a double-digit growth rate for a long time to come. Image source: Getty Images. Another growth stock that can make patient investors a boatload of money is cloud-based ad technology company PubMatic (NASDAQ:PUBM). People are consuming content from connected TV (CTV), over-the-top (OTT) media (i.e., media services offered via internet), and mobile in greater amounts. PubMatic aims to help publishers via real-time programmatic advertising transactions. Its cloud-based infrastructure can cover multiple ad platforms and devices, and it's exceptionally transparent from a price perspective. In other words, it's helping advertisers put their money to work in the most efficient way(s) possible. During the first quarter, the company processed 18.5 trillion impressions (that was up 106% from the prior-year period), with a net dollar-based retention rate of 130%. In English, this means existing publishers spent 30% more in Q1 2021 than they did in the prior-year quarter (Q1 2020). While adding new publishers is helpful and essential, the bulk of future cash flow growth is going to come from existing clients spending more.\u00a0 Just as impressive, mobile and omnichannel video (OTT/CTV) sales jumped 83% from the prior-year period and accounted for 63% of sales. Revenue growth was so robust in these segments that the company upped its full-year sales forecast range by $15 million on the low and high end to $195 million to $200 million. PubMatic finds itself at the center of the fastest-growing trends within the advertising space. This should give it a good chance to make its shareholders a boatload of money.

That's because Sea has a trio of rapidly growing operating segments. For the time being, the company's gaming division is generating all of its positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Sea ended March with almost 649 million quarterly active users (QAU). But the far more impressive figure is that close to 80 million of these gamers were paying customers. Most gaming companies see a low single-digit percentage of gamers pay to play. In Sea's case, 12.3% of its QAUs are paying, up from 8.9% in the first quarter of 2020. Looking further out, the company's e-commerce platform, Shopee, is far more exciting. Shopee has been an increasingly popular shopping destination for folks in Southeastern Asia and Brazil. By targeting regions with a burgeoning middle class, Sea has seen orders surge. In the March-ended quarter, gross orders were up 153% to 1.1 billion, with gross merchandise value effectively doubling to $12.6 billion. Shopee could help Sea double its revenue every two years throughout the decade. Lastly, Sea's nascent digital financial services segment is making waves. Total mobile wallet payments topped $3.4 billion in the first quarter, with the company counting over 26 million paying users. Since some of the regions Sea is targeting are underbanked, digital wallets could provide a financial services workaround for consumers.\u00a0 Suffice it to say, it offers a far more compelling long-term outlook than Dogecoin.

", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/16/is-ipo-stock-uipath-a-buy-after-its-first-quarter/", "date": "Wed, 16 Jun 2021 12:00:00 GMT", "content": "As the economy recovers from the effects of the pandemic, businesses across the country are reporting difficulty hiring employees and a shortage of workers. Some have left to work for themselves, others have quit simply to recapture some life-work balance. There has been concern vocalized in the past over AI's potential to eliminate jobs, but the fact of the matter is AI could be a necessary tool to help organizations evolve in a post-pandemic world that has a shortage of employee help. Software-based automation could have massive potential as a result. Enter robotic process automation (RPA) company UiPath (NYSE:PATH). The company just went public this past spring and had a fantastic showing in its first quarter since its initial public offering. It isn't a cheap stock, but if you are looking very long-term, it could be time to start nibbling. Image source: Getty Images. UiPath is the leader in RPA, robotic software that can automate tasks people don't have the time or desire to complete. Just like physical robots have replaced repetitive tasks in the manufacturing sector, RPA can help alleviate the tedious day-to-day grind in the office, like form completion, data entry, and compliance record keeping.  UiPath's platform has some notable competition. Microsoft\u00a0is a player in this field, as it seemingly is in all niches of the software realm, but other names include Pegasystems, Blue Prism, and Automation Anywhere. Low-code software development platform Appian\u00a0bought its way into the RPA space at the beginning of 2020 as well. \u00a0 But UiPath is the leader for a reason. Its software bots are available via subscription and can be deployed across legacy IT systems or set loose on the cloud. It makes use of computer vision -- the same AI system that Tesla and other automakers are utilizing in autonomous vehicle and advanced safety features -- to help its software bots  see  what's on a computer screen and intuitively get work done with minimal human input. UiPath says its total addressable market is currently worth $60 billion a year and going strong, which isn't farfetched if businesses continue to struggle hiring and staying up to date in the cloud era. RPA is entering the workforce, and robotic engineers (the software developers that train bots) are quickly becoming top human employees to help implement needed automation.  UiPath had an impressive first quarter of 2021 as a result of this demand for increased workflow automation. Revenue increased 65% year over year to $186 million. On an annualized basis, revenue was up 64% to $653 million. Free cash flow in Q1 was negative $20.1 million, but that is mostly by design as the company spends heavily on development of new RPA capabilities and on marketing. This will be a profitable company sooner rather than later, though. Gross profit margin on services rendered was at 74% in the quarter -- and is historically even higher than that (89% last year), but new product rollouts are dragging down the average for now until they get more customers and reach a more profitable scale.  This automation leader can afford to expand aggressively, too. It ended April 2021 with nearly $1.9 billion in cash and equivalents and zero debt, over four years' worth of operating expenses (when excluding non-cash stock-based compensation to employees) at the Q1 annualized run rate. The payoff could be huge. UiPath expects annual recurring revenue (ARR) to be at least $850 million by the end of this year, 30% higher than what it was in Q1 and 47% higher than last year.  But this growth comes at a steep premium. UiPath's market cap is at $35.5 billion as of this writing, valuing the company at over 41 times management's guidance for ARR this year. Is it worth the price tag? Clearly only if UiPath's current momentum is sustainable for at least a few more years -- and if it swings to profitability at some point. It has the potential to do so. The software industry is massive, and UiPath's current ARR is only around 1% of its immediate addressable market. Plus RPA is becoming a flexible option businesses can employ to automate a wide range of processes in their operations. If effects of the pandemic are here to stay (and I think they are), UiPath may just be getting started. \u00a0 But here's what I wouldn't advise: Don't go loading up on a ton of this stock. Keep your position (if you buy one at all) very small when starting out. When I make my first buy, it will likely be less than 0.5% of my total portfolio. With such a sky-high premium, UiPath is already priced to perfection, and this is no social media-hyped meme stock headed to the moon. I plan to just dip a toe in first and brace for some possible turbulence. That can be expected with high-growth, high-premium stocks, especially within the first couple of years after an IPO. But at the very least keep this RPA leader on your radar.

It's hard to give an objective answer to that question, but no matter where you stand on it, it's unquestionable that cryptocurrencies in general -- and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) in particular -- need to be a part of that discussion. As cryptocurrencies are increasingly perceived as a hedge against inflation, Dogecoin has skyrocketed in value in the past few months. Nevertheless, the long-term bull case for Dogecoin remains flimsy.\u00a0 For one, it remains a highly volatile asset. And random Tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk seem to be a major catalyst for its value to rise or fall, which is a worry in and of itself. Further, according to online business directory Cryptwerk, only about 1,300 businesses accept Dogecoin as payment,\u00a0which is a minuscule fraction of the total number of companies in the U.S. For these reasons (and many more), Dogecoin probably isn't your best bet if you're looking for an asset that can continue to perform well in the long run. Instead, it's best to turn to solid businesses with strong growth prospects. Two that fit the bill are Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM) and Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV).\u00a0  TNDM data by YCharts Medical devices specialist Tandem Diabetes Care has performed poorly in the stock market year to date. Since the beginning of the year, shares of the healthcare company are down by 8.03%, compared with gains of 12.34% for the S&P 500. Despite this poor showing for its shares, though, Tandem Diabetes's financial results continue to be strong.\u00a0 The company recorded sales of $141 million in the first quarter, 44% higher than the prior-year quarter. As a reminder, Tandem Diabetes makes the bulk of its revenue from the sale of its t:slim X2 insulin pump (and accompanying accessories), an innovative product for managing insulin-dependent diabetes. In the first quarter ending March 31, shipments of its crown jewel grew by 46% to 25,352.\u00a0 Tandem Diabetes isn't profitable yet, but its net loss per share shrunk to $0.08 during the first quarter, compared with $0.25 during the year-ago period. At least two factors could continue to fuel Tandem Diabetes' growth for many years to come. First, there is the unfortunate increase in the world's population of patients with diabetes. In the U.S. alone, about one in three people will have diabetes by 2050, according to some estimates.\u00a0Only 10% had diabetes in the country as of 2018, and only 0.93% did in 1958. Image Source: Getty Images. The need for products capable of making the lives of diabetes patients a bit easier won't subside anytime soon -- quite the contrary. Second, Tandem Diabetes continues to innovate. A major step forward for its t:slim X2 insulin pump was the clearance of its Control-IQ Technology by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) back in 2019. Control-IQ Technology is a feature that allows the t:slim X2 insulin pump to be used in conjunction with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) Systems such as Dexcom's G6.\u00a0When paired together, these two devices help diabetes patients keep their glucose levels within a desired range. The process is automated thanks to Tandem Diabetes' Control-IQ Technology feature. Tandem Diabetes recently reported results from a study that showed the use of the t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ Technology leads to improved time in range (the amount of time a person with diabetes spends within the target blood sugar level) for patients. The healthcare company is always looking to add new features to its products, and it is also working on newer, better insulin pumps. And with an underpenetrated addressable market in the U.S. and abroad, the company can still grow by leaps and bounds. Don't be fooled by its recent struggles in the market -- this healthcare stock still has many great days ahead. Now is as good a time as any to initiate a position. Veeva Systems is primarily a tech company; it provides cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) solutions to drugmakers and other players in the life sciences industry. The services Veeva Systems offers are in high demand for many reasons, one of which is that developing products in the life sciences industry is a legal and logistical nightmare. Veeva Systems' suite of offerings helps life science companies efficiently navigate these challenges while ensuring legal compliance. One way to gauge how happy the company's customers are with its products is by looking at the retention rates for its subscription services -- which make up the bulk of its revenue. During its past three fiscal years, the company had retention rates between 121% and 124%. Another way to gauge the success of Veeva Systems is by looking at the company's revenue growth. Veeva Systems' quarterly top line has increased by 230.1% over the past five years.\u00a0Veeva Systems' latest quarterly update was also impressive. In its Q1 2022, which ended April 30, the company reported revenue of $433.6 million, a 29% increase over the year-ago period. Earnings per share (EPS) climbed to $0.71, up from the $0.54 reported during the comparable period of the previous fiscal year. Veeva Systems can keep growing for many years to come. For one, the company is always working on newer and better products. Just last year, it introduced MyVeeva, a tool to speed up the clinical trial process for pharmaceutical companies. And that's just one of the more recent offerings in its arsenal. Also, Veeva Systems has been expanding into other industries in recent years, including consumer packaged goods (CPG), chemicals, and cosmetics. All three of these segments share one key similarity with the life science industry: they are highly regulated. Veeva Systems is looking to replicate the success it has already had with its entry into these industries. With a total addressable market worth at least $12 billion,\u00a0the company shows no sign of hitting a brick wall anytime soon. All these factors make Veeva Systems an excellent stock to buy today.

Even though stocks don't outperform bonds or commodities every year, they've delivered the highest average annual total returns over the very long run. However, this thesis has been put to the test over the past decade by the rise of cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin\u00a0has generated a triple-digit average annual return over the past decade. But it's not Bitcoin that's entranced retail investors. That honor goes to the so-called  people's currency,  Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE). Image source: Getty Images. Investors are typically excited about Dogecoin for three key reasons: The problem is that if you actually take the time to dig into these catalysts, you'll find more holes than you would in a slice of Swiss cheese. For example, while Dogecoin is nominally inexpensive, it's anything but  cheap  if we factor in the nearly 130 billion Dogecoin in circulation. Block rewards courtesy of mining activity -- crypto miners use high-powered computers to solve complex equations that validate transactions as true -- are creating about 5.2 billion new Dogecoin a year. In 2021, we're talking about inflation of just over 4%. That may not sound like much, but it's been well over a decade since the actual inflation rate in the U.S. has been higher than 4%. This means Dogecoin does a poor job of providing a hedge against inflation in the United States. There are also a number of holes in the bull thesis that Dogecoin's adoption is growing: And don't even get me started on Elon Musk's tweets and memes being able to create and destroy billions in market value in the crypto space. The stark reality is that Dogecoin is a poor investment and almost certainly a pump-and-dump scheme in action. Instead of putting your money to work in this ticking time bomb, my suggestion would be to forget about Dogecoin altogether and invest in great companies that can make you a millionaire. The following trio of stocks fits the bill perfectly. Image source: Getty Images. First up is technology-focused real estate company Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN), which has all the tools needed to make millionaires out of its shareholders. The real estate industry is stodgy, and Redfin is looking to shake things up in two ways. To begin with, it's aiming to save its customers a boatload of money. Traditional real estate firms take up to a 3% commission/listing fee when you buy or sell a home. Redfin's listing fees range between 1% and 1.5%, depending on how much business you've done with the company. Considering how home prices are soaring in the wake of historically low lending rates, the amount of money Redfin can save buyers and sellers is being magnified with each passing day. Aside from cost-savings, Redfin is also aiming to disrupt the real estate industry by personalizing and/or simplifying the buying and selling process as much as possible. For instance, it's introduced the RedfinNow service in a handful of cities. RedfinNow allows the company to purchase homes from sellers for cash, which removes the hassles homeowners typically deal with when selling their property. There's also Redfin Concierge, which can cost up to 2.5% of a home's selling price. Concierge works with sellers to stage homes or tackle upgrades that'll yield top-dollar from buyers. This combination of cost-savings and personalization has helped Redfin nearly triple its share of U.S. existing home sales since the end of 2015 (0.44% in Q4 2015 to 1.14% in Q2 2021). This is likely just the tip of the iceberg. Image source: Getty Images. Another millionaire-maker stock is The Original BARK Company (NYSE:BARK), which you might know best as dog-focused products and services company BarkBox. BARK officially completed its merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Northern Star Acquisition earlier this month. Let's start by stating the obvious: never... ever... bet against the companion animal industry. Since 1988, the percentage of U.S. households that owns a pet rose from 56% to 67%. What's more, year-over-year spending on U.S. pet expenditures hasn't declined in well over a quarter of a century. This year alone, almost $110 billion will be spent on our furry friends, according to estimates from the American Pet Products Association. Translation: People love their pets, and they'll pay big bucks to ensure their well-being and happiness. BARK provides that happiness via monthly subscriptions. The company's core offering delivers toys and treats each month to owners. As of the latest quarter, BarkBox had approximately 1.2 million subscribers (up 91% year-over-year), and the S-1 from last year noted a record-high retention rate among these subscribers. Keep in mind that since this is a subscription-driven model, BARK is basking in gross margin of around 60%. Similar to Redfin, innovation is also a key driver. Last year, BarkBox introduced Bark Home and Bark Eats. The former provides basic-need accessories like leashes, beds, and collars, whereas the latter works with owners to develop and deliver a high-quality dry food plan. Despite company expectations that sales will nearly double by 2023, BARK remains one of the cheapest pet stocks relative to its sales. This discount likely won't last much longer. Image source: Getty Images. A third stock that offers greater long-term prospects than Dogecoin and can make investors millionaires is Esports and gaming company Skillz (NYSE:SKLZ). Why Skillz? Instead of going head-to-head with big-name gaming developers, Skillz chose the highly profitable middleman route. It's developed a platform that allows gaming enthusiasts to compete against one another for cash prizes. In turn, Skillz and the developer(s) of the games being played keep a cut of the cash prize. Since it's a lot easier to maintain a gaming medium than to develop new games, Skillz boasts an impressive gross margin of 95%. Even though Skillz is still losing quite a bit of money as it ramps up marketing for its platform and its headcount, the initial gaming data is highly favorable. At the end of March, 17% of its gamers (467,000 people) were paying to play. That's at least eightfold higher than the industry average of 1.6% to 2% of gamers who pay to play.\u00a0 Investors will also want to keep a close eye on the multiyear agreement Skillz signed with the National Football League (NFL) in early February. Football is the unquestioned most-popular sport in the United States. If developers can find the end zone even a couple of times with NFL-themed games, this partnership with the NFL could really put Skillz on the map.

To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center. To get started investing, check out our quick-start guide to investing in stocks. A full transcript follows the video.   This video was recorded on June 4, 2021. Dylan Lewis: It's Friday, April 4th, [it was actually June 4] and we're talking about the industry powering the digital revolution. I'm your host Dylan Lewis, and you're actually not going to be hearing much from me today. We put out a lot of content here at The Fool. Every now and then I'll hear a conversation and think, this is darn good. We've got to get this in front of as many people as possible. On today's show, we're going to be airing a conversation between analysts John Rotonti and Jason Hall breaking down the semiconductor industry. It originated in our Discovery Now premium live stream and then later made its way into Motley Fool Live, our U.S. member live stream. It's a fantastic overview of the industry, the shortage that's been collecting headlines, and why this space is full of so many stellar businesses. Think of it as a little sneak peak for non-members and a reminder for all of our members that there are some awesome conversations happening over at live.fool.com. Without any further ado, enjoy. [...] Jason Hall: So before we talk about our show today, which is going to be focused on the semiconductor industry and what's going on there, I think it'd be great if you could just spend a couple of minutes talking about what you do for The Fool and what you enjoy the most about the things that you do. John Rotonti: Thank you, Jason. Yes. I'm a senior analyst. I've been at The Fool for seven years now and I'm the head of investor training and development. In that role I teach a lot of classes to our new analysts, that's one thing I do. In that role I also serve as a resource across our investment team. So if any member of our investing team is looking for an article or even maybe some WallStreet research on a particular company, or a model on a company, I may be able to help them with that. Third thing I do is I bring in outside guest speakers, practitioners, academics, all superstars in their fields and their area of expertise to come speak to our team internally, teach us classes, lead discussions. Sometimes I bring in a group of outside speakers and we host a round-table of panels and we get to watch these three or four amazing professional money managers have a discussion with each other for an hour and a half. That's how I spend my time as a coach. Then I'm the co-host of the morning show on Motley Fool Live, and the host of My Investing Life on Motley Fool Live, and then I'm experimenting with another show called Tech30, where I bring in some guests and interview them for 30 minutes and talk about tech and innovation. Hall: Awesome. Well, there's no doubt that tech and innovation is the old software city in the world. The bottom line is that every company that's not using technology in their business is going to lose to their biggest competitor who is. Rotonti: Exactly. Hall: So that's awesome. Well, John, again, thank you so much for coming on. I can tell you that every member, whether they have listened to you talk about companies that you follow, or back when you were working on some of the premium services and providing the analysis that led to recommendations, every single member has benefited from you because of your influence on so many of the other analysts and helping out with coaching and training. For every single member I want to extend a thank you to you for that. Rotonti: Thank you, Jason. Hall: Onto today's show we have a fun topic lined up. One of the [...] and it's in the consequences that's happened recently, that's had all kinds of far-reaching implications across all kinds of industries is the semiconductor shortage, right? Whether it was coming out of COVID and the impact on global supply chain, natural disasters, fires, booming economy, surging demands, the proliferation of semiconductors across so many more different types of products and over. It's an amazing, interesting industry that's in a bit of a disarray in terms of meeting supply, but has so many implications that investors need to understand. John, tell us what we need to know. Rotonti: Yeah, Jason. Regarding the shortage, you hit on most of the big ones. The biggest reason there's a semiconductor shortage right now, I think, is because of the digital acceleration that was brought on by COVID and the subsequent economic lockdown. Digital everything and the cloud was growing really fast before the pandemic, but the pandemic accelerated that growth, and those industries whether it's software, whether it's hardware, whatever it is in the digital space relies on semiconductors. When the digital transformation gets accelerated, literally by years, down into months the semiconductor manufacturers are already operating at full capacity or near full capacity and it takes time to ramp up semiconductor manufacturing. So that's a big thing. The industry was not ready for this accelerated digital transformation. You mentioned natural disasters. One major semiconductor fabrication facility was shut down by a fire, another by the decrease in taxes. Then a third thing I'll say is coming out of recessions or the economic shocks it's not uncommon to have supply constraints. It just so happened this time the supply constraint is showing up in semiconductors because of the digital acceleration we talked about and how important semiconductors are to everything digital. Hall: It's a confluence of events. There are so many things that have occurred all at the same time that have made what was going to be a tight supply situation even worse. You hit on something that I think is really important to understand and talk about bringing these facilities up to scale and adding more capacity. I think we've all gotten spoiled when we see CrowdStrike report earnings or Zoom report earnings or Shopify, where their revenues are up 50% or 100% from period to period. When you're dealing with software or Software-as-a-Service or something on the Cloud, you can scale up very quickly, but when you think about building foundry for semiconductors and a lot of times they're very specialized, right? Making sure that you are building out the right capacity for the rights need can be really critical. It does take time. It's very time-intensive, very labor-intensive, very energy-intensive, and then there's all the logistics of this. Yeah, it's very power-intensive. But then you have the logistics too of the inputs, your feedstocks that you need, and then getting the product out and then getting a distributor to where it needs to go. It's about as old schools as it gets. Rotonti: It takes years to build and $10 billion to $20 billion to build one modern-day advance node semiconductor manufacturing foundry. Hall: So the one that comes to mind most immediately on that actual company that we're not really going to talk much about, but that's Intel. This is one of the companies that have earmarked these massive worth $30 billion or so to add capacity. Maybe it's more than that, but to build out more capacity in North America. Rotonti: Yes. If you look at the three largest semiconductor manufacturing companies, Taiwan Semi (NYSE:TSM), I guess we should call them foundry. They're more accurately called foundries or fabrication facilities. But Taiwan Semi has announced they're going to spend $100 billion in CapEx over the next three years, $100 billion, Samsung that is going to spend over $100 billion over the next several years without specifying what several years means, and then you just said Intel. I thought it was $20 billion to build two fabs in Arizona, but maybe the number has gone up to $30 billion since the last. Hall: No. I think that sounds right. Rotonti: But it's a lot. I mean, it's a lot. Just three companies right there you're looking at, well, over $200 billion of industry CapEx in the next few years. That's a lot. Hall: It is. Then they are going to have to be regularly spending additional capital costs to modernize the update just to continue to meet the design expectations. Rotonti: Yep. Taiwan Semi is a leader in this. They are currently the only company globally at scale putting out five-nanometer chips, which is a leading-edge chip right now. They're going to open their first three-nanometer chip sometime in 2022. That's the timeline they've announced so far. So yeah, they're continuing to move, continuing to progress and innovate to more advanced chips. Hall: Before we get into the specific companies it might be helpful to talk about as you think about the industry and as you think about how the buckets that the industry is within and the companies that participate in what they do, can you break that down for our viewers? Rotonti: I can, for sure. What's remarkable is that at every stage of the semiconductor manufacturing value chain there's two or three and in some cases one global leader. We're really talking about earned oligopoly, earned duopolies, earned monopolies in some cases because as you said it's just so capital and knowledge-intensive that the barriers to entry are so high. If you look at how to make a leading-edge five-nanometer chip, for example, because these leading-edge chips they have billions of transistors on them and the chips are about the size of a stamp or a thumbnail. When I say billions, I mean billions, the Apple and one chip has 16 billion transistors. Amazon grabs a ton of chips and has close to 30 billion transistors, so tens of billions of transistors. You can't just put that together by hand. You need software. The first step is to design the blueprint for that tiny chip. How are you going to fit 20 or 30 billion transistors on it? There's two global leaders in software that do this design. It's called EDA software, Electronic Design Automation software. It's also sometimes referred to as computational design software, two global market share leaders, Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys. This computational design software is highly complicated. It's a mix of matrix algebra, artificial intelligence, advanced geometry, and other fields of math that I can't even pronounce or understand. It's really that complicated. To work as a software engineer in one of these companies you have to have a masters or a PhD. It's not just you take a class in Python or something like that. It's super-advanced. That's the first step, you design a blueprint of what the chip is going to look like on the software to global duopoly. The next step is basically a chip. Chip-making basically has a thousand steps. But you can basically break it down into, you deposit film onto the silicon; onto the wafer and the film is different chemicals. Then you etch away or cut away at that film. Then you wash with water. You repeat that tons of times. It's more complicated than that, but you repeated tons of times. The next step after you make this blueprint with a software, as you do the deposition, you deposit these layers of chemical onto the wafer. There's three companies that make these deposition machines, Applied Materials, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron. But in deposition, Applied Materials is the industry leader, once again, an oligopoly, after you have done the deposition, then you take the blueprint that was created with the software and it is shined. You use a light source and you project that blueprint through a mask and through a series of mirrors onto the chip. This mask and this series of mirrors shrink down that blueprint to the size of a chip. How it's done is really magical. There's only one company that provides the light source that is shined through this mask and through these mirrors to shrink the blueprint down onto the chip. That's ASML. It's the only company on earth that has this extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. Basically, it's a tiny wavelength of light that is shined through this mask in these mirrors to trace or stencil the pattern onto the silicon wafer. The way it works, people thought it was impossible. Industry experts thought it was impossible but ASML figured it out. A tiny drop of molten tin is hit by carbon dioxide lasers, CO2 lasers, and the lasers vaporize the molten tin. That tin turns into a ball of plasma, shining so bright that it creates this EUV, this extreme ultraviolet light source. The science is so complicated, no other company has been able to figure it out. This process of shining these lasers onto the tin, creating this plasma ball of light happens 50,000 times a second. The reason EUV extreme ultraviolet light is so important is because extreme ultraviolet light has a tiny wavelength of light. Hall: The wavelength. That's how you get smaller and smaller. Rotonti: If you're putting 20 billion transistors on a chip exactly right, those transitions have to be packed really close together. The tracing, the stenciling has to be used with a really small wavelength of light. We've deposited material. There are oligopoly of companies that make those machines. We've done the EUV lithography. There's only one company that makes those machines. They cost about $200 million. Then we have to etch away or carve away at the deposition to lay down the transistors and then to connect those transistors. There's three companies that make those machines. They're called etching machines, same three, Lam Research, Applied Materials, and Tokyo Electron. But in etch, Lam Research is the leader. At each stage of this value chain, you have monopolies, duopolies or oligopolies because these companies are so unique and so important and what they're doing is really bending the laws of physics. It's almost impossible to replicate. Hall: Well, I don't know if you're familiar with Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer. Rotonti: Sure. Hall: -- known for his Clarke's three laws. I think the perfect application of his third law is that,  Any technology that is sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.  Rotonti: You're exactly right. Industry insiders call this process of making a chip, they call it black magic. It's really complicated. All of this happens by the way, at one other company operating at global oligopoly. All of this takes place at a foundry, at a contract manufacturing facility, and the leader there as Taiwan Semiconductor. The deposition machines, Taiwan Semi buys them. The tech machines Taiwan Semi buys them. The extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from ASML, Taiwan Semi buys them. They spend the CapEx, they buy them, they put them in these massive facilities. Massive facilities are much bigger than a football field and they go through these thousands of steps. It's called a recipe and they make these advanced chips and the process is like magic. Hall: The business model works because if you're Apple or you're Microsoft or you're Ford, any one of these companies that's utilizing semiconductors even if you're designing them yourself, spending the capital to build out a facility to manufacture it yourself is almost nuts. Rotonti: These companies, they're called fabulous because they don't have fabs or fabrication facilities. That's exactly right. They put the CapEx burden onto Taiwan Semi. Hall: Right. Rotonti: It's a mutually exclusive relationship though. Taiwan Semi is getting good economics from this as well. Hall: That's the key. Unless you can produce massive volume for your own consumption, it can be cheaper to be fabulous. To use somebody else as manufacturer because when they operate at scale, the volumes they can produce drives down the per-unit cost, and they can be profitable, producing it for cheaper than you can do it if you did it in-house. Rotonti: That's exactly right. The way that these chips are made when you go from one generation of chips to the next, you start with the recipe. You start with the process of knowledge from the prior generation. To go from a seven-nanometer to five-nanometer, you start with a seven-nanometer and then you tweak it from there. Taiwan Semi has done more of these advanced chips than anybody else. They have more process knowledge than anybody else. Hall: Which is a major competitive advantage. Rotonti: It's a major competitive advantage, Jason and it's really hard for others to catch up because you can't skip steps. Intel is behind now. They have to do a seven-nanometer because they can't figure out how to do five or three without going through that process knowledge and learning those steps as they go. That process knowledge, that IP, the library of recipes that Taiwan Semi and Samsung has built up, and Intel to an extent, it's an amazing competitive advantage. Hall: Now that we've got a baseline of knowledge about the different parts of the industry and the levers that are tied to it, we've already been doing this for about 19 minutes, John, that's amazing. It feels like it's been 19 seconds. This is incredible. If we can spend maybe 10 minutes or so talking about some of the top companies here that you've identified that you like. Rotonti: Two or three of them I've discussed already, so we'll be able to be efficient with the 10 minutes we have. ASML is the only company on earth that has figured out extreme ultraviolet lithography. Hall: Right. Rotonti: Moore's Law says that every two years or so, the number of transistors doubles. The only way to double the number of transistors on a chip if the chip sizes change is to shrink the transistors, and push them closer and closer together and then to build these 3D chips and put them on top of each other. But the only way to do this shrinking is with this really ultraviolet wavelength of light. ASML is really the company that has allowed Moore's Law to continue to progress for so long. ASML has earned a monopoly. It is truly a magical company. They are bending the laws of physics, to catch up with them is going to be really hard. Lam Research I mentioned, then Taiwan Semi, I mentioned. All unique businesses as in my opinion, are as difficult to replicate as any business on earth. I'm not going to say it's impossible, but as difficult to replicate as any business on earth. One we haven't discussed yet is Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The ticker there is TXN. Once again, back to this theme. It operates in a global oligopoly or duopoly. Texas Instruments is the largest, excuse me, analog semiconductor company in the world. Texas Instruments and the No. 2 runner-up player Analog Devices. They control about 50% of the global market share for analog chips. Texas Instruments has an extremely diverse revenue base because they sell 100,000 different products to 100,000 different customers. They sell more products, their product portfolio, their menu of products is larger than any other semiconductor company on earth, and they sell to more customers than any other company on earth. Hundred thousand products, 100,000 customers, so really diverse revenue. The question I get most often with Texas Instruments is,  Why are they selling these analog chips when everything is going digital and digital is exciting and it's fun.  The reason is because TI is an amazing business, it's run by amazing leadership, and they realize that there's this analog paradox at work. You probably never heard that phrasing before. I don't think you'll read it in WallStreet Research but there's an analog paradox at work, meaning that as the world shifts to digital, the demand for analog grows in tandem. Hall: Yeah. Rotonti: It grows with it because analog chips, they do things like manage the power in your cellphone. Your cellphone is a digital device, but you need analog along with it. There's only a few companies really doing this at scale. Then the other great thing about analog chips, as the rest of the world is tripping over themselves getting into the digital space, analog chips have long life cycles. Texas Instruments is mainly focusing on autos and industrial. Rotonti: The average life cycle for one of their auto chips is seven years. The average life cycle for one of their industrial chips is 10 years. So these chips don't face the risk of technological obsolescence. Hall: When you say life cycle, you mean the period of time from when they manufacture the first one to when they manufacture the last one? Rotonti: Yeah. That's right, or the period of time before that chip goes out of style and it needs to be updated. Hall: Right. As compared to the chips that Apple designs and users, every new iteration of their iPhone has a new processor? Rotonti: They're already coming out with the M2, they came out with the M1 a year ago. That's exactly right. So there's no risk to Moore's Law with Texas Instruments. If they don't sell a chip this quarter, it's got a 10-year life, they'll sell it next quarter or next year at a high-margin. In fact, Texas Instruments is selling chips that were released 30 years ago. So on average, auto chips have about a seven-year life cycle, industrial is about a 10. They're still selling some chips they designed and manufactured 30 years ago. Keywords are manufactured, they're vertically integrated. They do their manufacturing in-house, unlike digital chip companies for the most part, and unlike their competitors. They are the only analog chip company. Only analog chip company, once again, a monopoly when it comes to this. Manufacturing chips using 300-millimeter fabrication, which reduces the cost to manufacture these analog chips by 40%. So they have ultra-low cost manufacturing because they do it in-house. Manufacturing through their in-house manufacturing facilities carries incremental growth margins of 70% to 75%. You see incredible margins, incredible returns on capital from a company like this, and they're the only company manufacturing in-house in their space. Hall: It's good to be the king. I think that's the situation with Texas Instruments. Rotonti: It's exactly right, and because they control their supply chain more than their competitors, given the backdrop we're in right now with the shortage of semiconductors, their customers aren't experiencing as much of a shortage because they control that supply chain. They're vertically integrated. There's some shortage. There's some hotspots, they call them, but for the most part, their customers are getting the chips they need. It's a fantastic business. Hall: Here is an interesting thing. Every single one of these companies has outperformed the S&P 500 over that period. That certainly supports two things. No. 1, the trend, the growth, the tailwind for semiconductors, and it does tend to indicate that the market supports you, John, as saying that these are the leaders in this space. Rotonti: That would hold if you look at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Manufacturing Index and you go back 10 years, it beats the market 10 years. It beats the S&P. My point is it holds going back further, but just looking at the companies that you mentioned today, one of the reasons they beat the index, Jason, is because they weren't trading at these valuations that's some software. Amazing software companies and I love them, but the semiconductor companies weren't trading at the valuation some of these software companies were, so they haven't fallen as much. So if you look at Texas Instruments, Jason, it's down 10% from its 52-week high. Fastly is down 65%. If things aren't falling as much, it helps when it comes to outperformance. Hall: It does. It's also a reminder that to a lesser extent, this asset rotation sell-off that we've seen from some of our more interesting names has still impacted even this industry, even though we know that there's strong demand with. It's an opportunity, I think that's the key. It's predictability and opportunity. Rotonti: The other reason they're outperforming, this is Lam Research, this is from New Constructs. They put out really rigorous calculations of free cash flow and returns on invested capital. Look at Lam Research's returns on invested capital. Going from 2016 to 21% trailing 12-month 54%. The average return on invested capital, which is a measure of profitability and efficiency for the market, is about 12%. This is a company that's generated returns on invested capital of 54%. Hall: So that screams demand, that screams competitive advantage, and that screams amazing economics. Rotonti: Yeah. Hall: Oh, by the way, we're really good at capital allocation. Rotonti: Exactly. You look at free cash flow margins, free cash flow is over sales, 17%, 22%, 20%, 26%. Turning $0.20 of every $1 into free cash flow, pretty impressive. Hall: Yeah, that's incredible. Those are numbers to get excited about. Rotonti: You mentioned the demand, maybe one thing to talk about from a high level, another reason, these stocks and the industry, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is outperforming so well, is the thesis for the industry. There are critical infrastructure components to the digital revolution and everything digital, it's a large and growing market and so you've got the long term tailwind. There's no aspect of the modern digital economy that can function without semiconductors, zero. Cloud, artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G video games, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, sensors and wearables, the Internet of Things, automation, robotics, crypto, mining, space travel, there is no aspect of the digital revolution that can exist without semiconductors. I hear a lot of investors say that it's Cloud computing that is powering the digital revolution. Hall: But what's powering Cloud computing? Rotonti: Exactly, Jason, and I would agree with that. The cloud is a game changer, but it's a slight oversimplification because without semis, there's no Cloud. Then you mentioned cyclicality really early. I just want to hit on that really quickly. The industry is cyclical. There's no doubt about it, but much less cyclical than in the past. Three reasons for that. One, now they're growing into everything. The cycles used to be driven by the PC cycle and the smartphone cycle. Now they're in everything, including Cloud data centers and servers and everything. Now they're in everything, that's No. 1. No. 2, there's been several waves of massive consolidation in the industry and we're in one of those waves right now. When an industry consolidates, the remaining players become more rational. Then the third reason, you mentioned earlier, now the OEMs themselves, the largest, most profitable, biggest companies in the world, are designing their own semiconductors. It's a whole new customer base; Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Google [Alphabet], Microsoft, talking about this. They're all designing their own semiconductors now. So now that market opportunity is so much bigger. Hall: Yeah. I think that also changes the capital allocation model, because if you're no longer designing and building it, you're not really thinking about the capital investment you'll have to make to build that new design. It just completely changes the economics. Rotonti: Totally. Then the final thing we touched on when I shared my screen, the fundamentals for semis have been misunderstood for a while. They're being better understood, but I still think they're underappreciated. If you look at a list of the best semiconductor companies and put it up against a list of the best software companies, the corporate fundamentals are every bit as good for the best semiconductor companies as they are for the best software companies. Their profitability and their returns on capital are exceptional. Their growth is not as good as software, but they are definitely growing far above GDP. The most recent downturn in the cycle was 2018 or 2019, the trough margins, so the worst the margins got in the most recent down-cycle, were better than the prior peak markets. Hall: That's a tremendous amount. Rotonti: Due to different industries. Hall: Well, I think another thing that's worth mentioning too, is the way that the industry has changed. It seems like it supports more of the stakeholders in a better way, if you think about it. Rotonti: I think so. Hall: That is an indication that all of those strong economic factors in these businesses and the way that they're operated and the returns that they can generate for investors, seems like it predicts that that should continue to prove to be the case. Rotonti: I would agree with that, Jason. I'm not saying they're not cyclical, but I think that there is less cyclicality than in the past. I think they will generate higher margins and higher returns on capital across a cycle than in the past, and I think over a long period of time, they will, as a group, and especially the best players that we discussed here today, we'll continue to outperform the market. Hall: Well, you heard it right here, ladies and gentlemen. I think it'd be fair to say that a basket of these five great companies and these various parts probably work out pretty well as a good way to invest in semiconductors over the next five to 10 years. Rotonti: I think so. [...] Lewis: Listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus.
